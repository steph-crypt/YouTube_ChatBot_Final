what alphafold you know and all its

normally this would take people months

normally this would take people months
if not years to work out this 3D

a few hundred,000 examples. So,
a few hundred,000 examples. So,
a few hundred,000 examples. So,
chemists, biochemists over the last 50
chemists, biochemists over the last 50
chemists, biochemists over the last 50
years, they've been working out these
years, they've been working out these

literally synthesizing protein,

literally synthesizing protein,
crystallizing it, then shooting X-rays
crystallizing it, then shooting X-rays
crystallizing it, then shooting X-rays
at this to like look at the electron
at this to like look at the electron
at this to like look at the electron
scattering and from that you can resolve

the protein structure. It's it's a
the protein structure. It's it's a
the protein structure. It's it's a
pretty hard process, but people have
pretty hard process, but people have
pretty hard process, but people have
been doing that. That's your way to

Alphold 2, right, was that big jump
Alphold 2, right, was that big jump
Alphold 2, right, was that big jump
where we started to get experimental

where we started to get experimental
level accuracy for just proteins and

that's what won the Nobel Prize. So, you
that's what won the Nobel Prize. So, you
that's what won the Nobel Prize. So, you
balance it off against empirical
balance it off against empirical
balance it off against empirical
experiment. The benchmark is doing the

real lab work itself, right? So, Alpha 2
real lab work itself, right? So, Alpha 2

reached that level. Now, AlphaFold 3
reached that level. Now, AlphaFold 3
reached that level. Now, AlphaFold 3
expands from just just proteins to

been talking in this conversation about
been talking in this conversation about
been talking in this conversation about
drug design, but then once you've

we have mice. But even these mice
we have mice. But even these mice
we have mice. But even these mice
models, they're not actually very

there's a lot to be done and like
there's a lot to be done and like
there's a lot to be done and like
rethought that rethought that is the

much all of our molecular machinery. So
much all of our molecular machinery. So
much all of our molecular machinery. So
there's there's a class of disease which
there's there's a class of disease which
there's there's a class of disease which

proteins in the bacteria. Okay. So
proteins in the bacteria. Okay. So
proteins are the fundamental machinery
proteins are the fundamental machinery
proteins are the fundamental machinery
and the chemicals which are drugs are

design is really hard because it's not

just about targeting these proteins. We
just about targeting these proteins. We
just about targeting these proteins. We
got to get them to the right place. We
got to get them to the right place. We
got to get them to the right place. We
might want a pill that you take. So you
might want a pill that you take. So you
might want a pill that you take. So you
take this pill, it's got to be absorbed
take this pill, it's got to be absorbed
take this pill, it's got to be absorbed
by the body. So it's got to be soluble,
by the body. So it's got to be soluble,
by the body. So it's got to be soluble,
right? It's got to go through the gut
right? It's got to go through the gut
right? It's got to go through the gut
wall. It's got to go through the

bloodstream to the particular tissue
bloodstream to the particular tissue
type, the cell type you care about. then

type, the cell type you care about. then
it's got to go through the cell membrane
it's got to go through the cell membrane
it's got to go through the cell membrane
to be able to actually target maybe a
to be able to actually target maybe a
to be able to actually target maybe a
target which is within the cell. So you
target which is within the cell. So you
target which is within the cell. So you
need all of these properties in a single
need all of these properties in a single
need all of these properties in a single
molecule. So we're actually designing
molecule. So we're actually designing
molecule. So we're actually designing
these molecules not just to hit the
these molecules not just to hit the
these molecules not just to hit the
protein but also to be soluble to be
protein but also to be soluble to be
protein but also to be soluble to be
cell permeable. There's so many
cell permeable. There's so many
cell permeable. There's so many
different factors and then you don't
different factors and then you don't
different factors and then you don't
want this molecule to be toxic. So you
want this molecule to be toxic. So you
want this molecule to be toxic. So you
want it to hit the target of interest
want it to hit the target of interest
want it to hit the target of interest
but not hit anything else. So I can see
but not hit anything else. So I can see
but not hit anything else. So I can see
how a molecule gets through the cell
how a molecule gets through the cell
how a molecule gets through the cell

fullup protein, red-blooded protein,
fullup protein, red-blooded protein,
fullup protein, red-blooded protein,
how's that getting through the cell
how's that getting through the cell
how's that getting through the cell

of drugs. Some are what we call small
of drugs. Some are what we call small
of drugs. Some are what we call small
molecules, things you could take as
molecules, things you could take as
molecules, things you could take as
pills. Others are made from proteins
pills. Others are made from proteins
pills. Others are made from proteins
there. They're often things that you
there. They're often things that you
there. They're often things that you
would inject directly inside. So you um
would inject directly inside. So you um
would inject directly inside. So you um
and some of those might be cell
and some of those might be cell
and some of those might be cell
permeable. They would be things like
permeable. They would be things like
permeable. They would be things like
peptides, but often these these protein
peptides, but often these these protein
peptides, but often these these protein
based drugs, things like antibodies, uh
based drugs, things like antibodies, uh
based drugs, things like antibodies, uh
they're injected, but they don't go in
they're injected, but they don't go in
they're injected, but they don't go in
the cell. they're just interacting with
the cell. they're just interacting with
the cell. they're just interacting with
proteins on the surface of cells. So,
proteins on the surface of cells. So,
proteins on the surface of cells. So,
you don't need that permeability. So, it
you don't need that permeability. So, it
you don't need that permeability. So, it
really depends on what your target is
really depends on what your target is
really depends on what your target is
and how do you want people to be able to
and how do you want people to be able to
and how do you want people to be able to
take that drug. Sometimes a pill is the
take that drug. Sometimes a pill is the
take that drug. Sometimes a pill is the
best thing, but actually sometimes
best thing, but actually sometimes
best thing, but actually sometimes
injecting is the best thing. Yes. And
injecting is the best thing. Yes. And
injecting is the best thing. Yes. And
remind me what a peptide is. A peptide
remind me what a peptide is. A peptide
remind me what a peptide is. A peptide
is a really small protein. Um, so you
is a really small protein. Um, so you
is a really small protein. Um, so you
got full-blown proteins which are these
got full-blown proteins which are these
got full-blown proteins which are these
big molecular machines and then you've
big molecular machines and then you've
big molecular machines and then you've
got small proteins um made up of, you
got small proteins um made up of, you
got small proteins um made up of, you
know, five to 50 amino acids. Those are
know, five to 50 amino acids. Those are
know, five to 50 amino acids. Those are
peptides. Those are peptides. They're
peptides. Those are peptides. They're

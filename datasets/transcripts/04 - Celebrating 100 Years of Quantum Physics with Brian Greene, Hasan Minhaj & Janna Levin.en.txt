you can envision a static universe. Now,

Bang by by Fred Hoy. By Fred Hy. Yeah.
Bang by by Fred Hoy. By Fred Hy. Yeah.
So Fred Hoy was in a 1948 BBC radio
So Fred Hoy was in a 1948 BBC radio
So Fred Hoy was in a 1948 BBC radio
interview. Why do you know this level of
interview. Why do you know this level of
interview. Why do you know this level of
detail about Okay. And so he is
detail about Okay. And so he is
detail about Okay. And so he is
describing his own approach which as you
describing his own approach which as you
describing his own approach which as you
mentioned is a steadystate approach
mentioned is a steadystate approach
mentioned is a steadystate approach
where matter is created spontaneously
where matter is created spontaneously
where matter is created spontaneously
and fills in the gaps in space. And so
and fills in the gaps in space. And so
and fills in the gaps in space. And so
they ask him about this other approach
they ask him about this other approach
they ask him about this other approach
not his. And he says oh that theory in
not his. And he says oh that theory in
not his. And he says oh that theory in
which all matter must be created in one
which all matter must be created in one
which all matter must be created in one
big bang. And that's where the idea of
big bang. And that's where the idea of
big bang. And that's where the idea of
big bang theory comes from. Now people
big bang theory comes from. Now people
big bang theory comes from. Now people
have interpreted that as a derogatory
have interpreted that as a derogatory
have interpreted that as a derogatory
description. His own way of recounting
description. His own way of recounting
description. His own way of recounting
the story is he was simply trying to
the story is he was simply trying to
the story is he was simply trying to
draw a distinction between a theory in

that's all that you need. And so it's

Yeah. Yeah. So what do we have to assume
Yeah. Yeah. So what do we have to assume
Yeah. Yeah. So what do we have to assume
if there is a big bang? So we got to
if there is a big bang? So we got to
if there is a big bang? So we got to
assume that the expansion has been
assume that the expansion has been
assume that the expansion has been
uniform the whole time. Not it doesn't
uniform the whole time. Not it doesn't

And unless there's extra dimensions,
And unless there's extra dimensions,
And unless there's extra dimensions,
those might All right. Well, so it could

expand differently enough. Brian and I
expand differently enough. Brian and I

are talking about this later. Well,

are talking about this later. Well,
yeah, you can squeeze the other
yeah, you can squeeze the other
yeah, you can squeeze the other

But the way you get this is looking at
But the way you get this is looking at
But the way you get this is looking at
the rate at which the universe is
the rate at which the universe is
the rate at which the universe is
expanding. Yes. And that is a slope on a

it's there's a slope. He called it the
it's there's a slope. He called it the
it's there's a slope. He called it the
letter C which is for constant. But
letter C which is for constant. But

since then we swapped that out with a
since then we swapped that out with a

capital H for Hubble and we call it the

All right. So Hubble I he had the wrong

turned out uh the sephiid variable he

he didn't know at the time there were
he didn't know at the time there were
he didn't know at the time there were

presumed they were the same. No reason
presumed they were the same. No reason
presumed they were the same. No reason
to think otherwise. So he got the wrong
to think otherwise. So he got the wrong
to think otherwise. So he got the wrong

diabetes is type one and type two. Yes,
diabetes is type one and type two. Yes,

there's a type one and type two.
there's a type one and type two.
there's a type one and type two.
Exactly. I think

Yes, there's literally type one sephiid
Yes, there's literally type one sephiid
Yes, there's literally type one sephiid
and type two sephiate. And you got to
and type two sephiate. And you got to
and type two sephiate. And you got to
use apples and apples when you're doing
use apples and apples when you're doing
use apples and apples when you're doing
this exercise. So, so he got an age of

the universe of two billion years. We
the universe of two billion years. We

when I was in graduate school many moons
when I was in graduate school many moons

constant was a factor of two. It there
was a 10. So, with the with the Hubble

Ask how much time at this expansion rate

looking backwards, when do we get to

And so if I'm off by a factor of two,
And so if I'm off by a factor of two,
And so if I'm off by a factor of two,
between 10 billion and 20 billion, yeah,
between 10 billion and 20 billion, yeah,
between 10 billion and 20 billion, yeah,
I could have been off by a factor of 10,
I could have been off by a factor of 10,

like being Jeff Bezos, you know, if I'm
like being Jeff Bezos, you know, if I'm

off by 10 billion, eh, not so bad.
So, so can I also ask you the second

When it was 10 and 20 billion, you
When it was 10 and 20 billion, you
When it was 10 and 20 billion, you
always have to report your uncertainties
always have to report your uncertainties
always have to report your uncertainties
for a number in science. And those
for a number in science. And those
for a number in science. And those
uncertainties had a little bit of

uncertainties had a little bit of
overlap in the middle. And it landed
overlap in the middle. And it landed
overlap in the middle. And it landed
where you expected it to land. Now that
where you expected it to land. Now that
where you expected it to land. Now that
we have two other waring factions on the

numbers are within 5% of each other, but
numbers are within 5% of each other, but
numbers are within 5% of each other, but
the uncertainties are tight. Yeah. So
the uncertainties are tight. Yeah. So
the uncertainties are tight. Yeah. So
the uncertainties don't overlap. And if

Why can't you measure both at the same
Why can't you measure both at the same
Why can't you measure both at the same
time? Well, if you have a particle
time? Well, if you have a particle
time? Well, if you have a particle
described as a wave, right, and you want
described as a wave, right, and you want
described as a wave, right, and you want
that particle to have a definite
that particle to have a definite
that particle to have a definite
location, that wave has to be highly
location, that wave has to be highly
location, that wave has to be highly
spiked. So that you can say, ah, almost

100% likelihood it's at this location.
100% likelihood it's at this location.
100% likelihood it's at this location.
But when you see how the notion of

velocity comes into quantum mechanics,
velocity comes into quantum mechanics,
velocity comes into quantum mechanics,
it has to do with the wavelength of the

it has to do with the wavelength of the

have a definite speed, it has to have a
have a definite speed, it has to have a

definite wavelength. That's not spiky.
definite wavelength. That's not spiky.
So to have definite location, you need

what Brian just said, but sometimes I
what Brian just said, but sometimes I

like this musical analogy. If you play a

chord, which is a whole bunch of notes
chord, which is a whole bunch of notes
chord, which is a whole bunch of notes
together, you can play chords, but you
together, you can play chords, but you
together, you can play chords, but you
can't simultaneously be playing a single
can't simultaneously be playing a single
can't simultaneously be playing a single
note. So the chord is like a
note. So the chord is like a
note. So the chord is like a
superposition of the notes. And how this
superposition of the notes. And how this
superposition of the notes. And how this
relates is that when you're in a precise
relates is that when you're in a precise
relates is that when you're in a precise
location, what Brian's describing as a

sharp spike, you're sort of in a superp
sharp spike, you're sort of in a superp
sharp spike, you're sort of in a superp
position of velocities or momenta. So
position of velocities or momenta. So
position of velocities or momenta. So
it's like it's like the the location is
it's like it's like the the location is
it's like it's like the the location is
the note, the the velocities are the
the note, the the velocities are the
the note, the the velocities are the
chords. Or vice versa, if I know the

I'm no longer playing individual. I'm

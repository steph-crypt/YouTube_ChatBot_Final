this other ingredient is found with

00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:47.039 align:start position:0%
uranium yeah so that's pretty wild she
 

00:17:47.039 --> 00:17:49.310 align:start position:0%
uranium yeah so that's pretty wild she

inferred its existence exactly because
 

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:51.110 align:start position:0%
inferred its existence exactly because
pure<00:17:49.679><c> uranium</c><00:17:50.360><c> wouldn't</c><00:17:50.600><c> do</c><00:17:50.720><c> that</c><00:17:50.960><c> she</c>

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
pure uranium wouldn't do that she
 

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.270 align:start position:0%
pure uranium wouldn't do that she
already<00:17:51.480><c> tested</c><00:17:51.919><c> that</c><00:17:52.240><c> she</c><00:17:52.440><c> knew</c><00:17:52.880><c> what</c><00:17:53.080><c> its</c>

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
already tested that she knew what its
 

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:56.110 align:start position:0%
already tested that she knew what its

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:56.120 align:start position:0%

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.510 align:start position:0%
strength was and this was much much

00:17:58.510 --> 00:17:58.520 align:start position:0%

00:17:58.520 --> 00:17:59.630 align:start position:0%

make<00:17:58.640><c> sure</c><00:17:58.840><c> sure</c><00:17:58.960><c> if</c><00:17:59.039><c> she</c><00:17:59.120><c> didn't</c><00:17:59.320><c> make</c><00:17:59.440><c> a</c>

00:17:59.630 --> 00:17:59.640 align:start position:0%

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:55.270 align:start position:0%
filling in the Gap that were there right
oh<00:18:53.520><c> yeah</c><00:18:53.799><c> right</c><00:18:53.919><c> there</c><00:18:54.000><c> were</c><00:18:54.120><c> a</c><00:18:54.240><c> lot</c><00:18:54.400><c> of</c>

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:23.630 align:start position:0%
big advantage over natural radioactive
elements<00:28:21.799><c> because</c><00:28:22.240><c> they</c><00:28:22.399><c> would</c><00:28:22.919><c> Decay</c><00:28:23.360><c> to</c>

00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:23.640 align:start position:0%
elements because they would Decay to
 

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:27.029 align:start position:0%

so<00:28:27.320><c> they</c><00:28:27.480><c> could</c><00:28:27.679><c> make</c><00:28:28.320><c> that</c>

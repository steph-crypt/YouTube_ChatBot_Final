put it in he had a prism and the light
put it in he had a prism and the light
put it in he had a prism and the light
coming through and there's like the

puts a thermometer there and then he

goes to to check and to compare and he
goes to to check and to compare and he
goes to to check and to compare and he
discovers that the hottest thermometer
discovers that the hottest thermometer
discovers that the hottest thermometer
was the one where there was no light
was the one where there was no light

coming in and 100 thermometers later
and so is it is it a mistake is it a and

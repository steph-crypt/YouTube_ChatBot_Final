I don't know that it helps. So, how can

I don't know that it helps. So, how can
you dig into that and unpack what's

ways we we can think about that is it's
ways we we can think about that is it's

so that's really the wavy part of

try to do that. So what quantum
try to do that. So what quantum
try to do that. So what quantum

moving more than their quantum

properties would allow. Okay. So let's
properties would allow. Okay. So let's

let's talk about the light. Um the
let's talk about the light. Um the
let's talk about the light. Um the
quantization of the light says a light
quantization of the light says a light
quantization of the light says a light
has two properties. Lights made up of

photons. And if I want to make a
photons. And if I want to make a
photons. And if I want to make a
measurement of that, I want to know two
measurement of that, I want to know two
measurement of that, I want to know two
things about it. What was the energy of
things about it. What was the energy of
things about it. What was the energy of
the photons that I'm measuring? And when
the photons that I'm measuring? And when
the photons that I'm measuring? And when
did they arrive on my detector? And you
did they arrive on my detector? And you
did they arrive on my detector? And you
can't know those two things at the same
can't know those two things at the same
can't know those two things at the same
time with infinite precision with

But you can know one of those properties
But you can know one of those properties
But you can know one of those properties
very very well if you allow the other
very very well if you allow the other
very very well if you allow the other
one to be very unknown that quantum
one to be very unknown that quantum
one to be very unknown that quantum
mechanics allows you to do and that's
mechanics allows you to do and that's
mechanics allows you to do and that's
the trick we play. So if we are
the trick we play. So if we are
the trick we play. So if we are
interested as we are in our measurement
interested as we are in our measurement
interested as we are in our measurement
measuring the phase of the light wave
measuring the phase of the light wave
measuring the phase of the light wave
the phase would be because you have two
the phase would be because you have two
the phase would be because you have two
light beams and you have to see how they
light beams and you have to see how they
light beams and you have to see how they
match up. That's right. Because if they
match up. That's right. Because if they
match up. That's right. Because if they
match up perfectly nothing happened to
match up perfectly nothing happened to
match up perfectly nothing happened to
one relative to the other. Gotcha. But
one relative to the other. Gotcha. But
one relative to the other. Gotcha. But
if if if a wave washes over, then one
if if if a wave washes over, then one
if if if a wave washes over, then one
jiggles a little differently and you
jiggles a little differently and you
jiggles a little differently and you
will the waves don't match up that
will the waves don't match up that
will the waves don't match up that
you'll see the Okay. So, right. So,
you'll see the Okay. So, right. So,
you'll see the Okay. So, right. So,
that's exactly right. So say if you're
that's exactly right. So say if you're
that's exactly right. So say if you're
interested in in measuring the phase
interested in in measuring the phase
interested in in measuring the phase
then what you can do is you can create

4 kilometers down and come back, there's
4 kilometers down and come back, there's
4 kilometers down and come back, there's
an added complication, if you will,
an added complication, if you will,
an added complication, if you will,
which is that in that 4 kilometer span,
which is that in that 4 kilometer span,
which is that in that 4 kilometer span,
we have a pair of mirrors that are
we have a pair of mirrors that are
we have a pair of mirrors that are
facing each other. And just like when
facing each other. And just like when
facing each other. And just like when
you put your own head between two
you put your own head between two
you put your own head between two
mirrors and you see multiple images, the
mirrors and you see multiple images, the
mirrors and you see multiple images, the
light is bouncing multiple times between
light is bouncing multiple times between
light is bouncing multiple times between
those. It's a way of of increasing the

path length, if you will. All right. So
path length, if you will. All right. So
path length, if you will. All right. So
and so it bounces in our case in LIOS
and so it bounces in our case in LIOS
and so it bounces in our case in LIOS
case about 100 times. Okay. So but then
case about 100 times. Okay. So but then
case about 100 times. Okay. So but then
it has to come back through to recon to
it has to come back through to recon to
it has to come back through to recon to

re to recombine. Yes. Okay. So you have
your magic waves that you it goes up and
your magic waves that you it goes up and
your magic waves that you it goes up and

light has to come back through and not
light has to come back through and not
light has to come back through and not
reflect back. Correct. And then you
reflect back. Correct. And then you
reflect back. Correct. And then you
compare the waves of the light from the
compare the waves of the light from the
compare the waves of the light from the
two the two arms. Yeah. So that's the

arrange the the distances such that the
arrange the the distances such that the
arrange the the distances such that the

in the ideal case you would see no light
in the ideal case you would see no light

light coming through. Okay. So this a
light coming through. Okay. So this a

very expensive demo here. So this is
very expensive demo here. So this is
very expensive demo here. So this is
this is actually knocking out half of
this is actually knocking out half of
this is actually knocking out half of
the light in there cuz only half it's an
the light in there cuz only half it's an
the light in there cuz only half it's an
unpolarized source. So half of it's
unpolarized source. So half of it's
unpolarized source. So half of it's
polarized one way, half it's polarized
polarized one way, half it's polarized
polarized one way, half it's polarized
the other way. The source is
the other way. The source is
the other way. The source is
unpolarized. And then if you put another
unpolarized. And then if you put another
unpolarized. And then if you put another
polarized source in front of it and I as
polarized source in front of it and I as
polarized source in front of it and I as
I rotate it eventually the axis of
I rotate it eventually the axis of
I rotate it eventually the axis of
polarization will be orthogonal and that
polarization will be orthogonal and that
polarization will be orthogonal and that
will block out 100% of the light. Do you
will block out 100% of the light. Do you
will block out 100% of the light. Do you
see perpendicular? There it is. So now
see perpendicular? There it is. So now
see perpendicular? There it is. So now
it's completely orthogonal or
it's completely orthogonal or
it's completely orthogonal or
perpendicular as as you would say. Uh
perpendicular as as you would say. Uh
perpendicular as as you would say. Uh
and then if I as I rotate it slightly
and then if I as I rotate it slightly
and then if I as I rotate it slightly
the offaxis now lets in some light. So
the offaxis now lets in some light. So
the offaxis now lets in some light. So
that's how polarization works. That's
that's how polarization works. That's
that's how polarization works. That's

yes Okay, tightly tightly coupled matter
yes Okay, tightly tightly coupled matter
yes Okay, tightly tightly coupled matter
and radiation. The universe been

expanding and cooling. So eventually it
expanding and cooling. So eventually it
expanding and cooling. So eventually it
will get into the radio waves but you
will get into the radio waves but you
will get into the radio waves but you
know keep paying your taxes because

that's going to take billions of years.
that's going to take billions of years.

the wavelength 10 times bigger is
the wavelength 10 times bigger is
the wavelength 10 times bigger is
basically when we start calling it a
basically when we start calling it a
basically when we start calling it a
radio wave. Okay. So the universe has to
radio wave. Okay. So the universe has to

be 10 times bigger because it's
be 10 times bigger because it's
be 10 times bigger because it's

cesium? It's like nine decimal places.
cesium? It's like nine decimal places.
cesium? It's like nine decimal places.
I'm sorry. Oh. So it's that that's why
I'm sorry. Oh. So it's that that's why
I'm sorry. Oh. So it's that that's why
it's an atomic clock and it's why it's
it's an atomic clock and it's why it's
it's an atomic clock and it's why it's
very precise, right? Because if you got

that vibration, for the vibration the
chemist tells us about it is 9
bill192,631,770 cycles of that
bill192,631,770 cycles of that

transition metals are called transition
transition metals are called transition
transition metals are called transition
metals is because they go through
metals is because they go through
metals is because they go through
different color changes. And so you can
different color changes. And so you can
different color changes. And so you can
actually see them transition through
actually see them transition through
actually see them transition through
their oxidation states. And so maybe
their oxidation states. And so maybe
their oxidation states. And so maybe
they're a plus two or a plus three. You
they're a plus two or a plus three. You
they're a plus two or a plus three. You
can see the color change across the
can see the color change across the
can see the color change across the

go through different oxidation states so
go through different oxidation states so
go through different oxidation states so
you can actually monitor it. So in

organic chemists, which is what I do, we
organic chemists, which is what I do, we
organic chemists, which is what I do, we
usually like color changes and that's
usually like color changes and that's
usually like color changes and that's
one of the reasons why we're drawn to
one of the reasons why we're drawn to
one of the reasons why we're drawn to
that field is because we work with

also what I taught which is general
also what I taught which is general

we say if something is like this it will
we say if something is like this it will
we say if something is like this it will
operate like this. We just try to

Okay. And so and so that's what's hard
Okay. And so and so that's what's hard
Okay. And so and so that's what's hard
about teaching it, especially in high

move around to be stable. If you have,

move around to be stable. If you have,
let's say you have five orbitals,
let's say you have five orbitals,
let's say you have five orbitals,
there's 5 d orbitals. If you have two
there's 5 d orbitals. If you have two
there's 5 d orbitals. If you have two

five d orbs. You all knew it. Yeah, we
five d orbs. You all knew it. Yeah, we
five d orbs. You all knew it. Yeah, we
totally knew that. If you have two
totally knew that. If you have two
totally knew that. If you have two
electrons in each one, that provides
electrons in each one, that provides
electrons in each one, that provides
stability. But if you have two two two
stability. But if you have two two two
stability. But if you have two two two
and then one, it's less stable. And so
and then one, it's less stable. And so
and then one, it's less stable. And so
what it does is it takes another

about um figuring out what ratio of
about um figuring out what ratio of
about um figuring out what ratio of
neutrons to protons makes an atom most
neutrons to protons makes an atom most
neutrons to protons makes an atom most
stable. And so if you have 20 protons or
stable. And so if you have 20 protons or
stable. And so if you have 20 protons or
fewer the ratio is 1 one. If you have
fewer the ratio is 1 one. If you have
fewer the ratio is 1 one. If you have
more than 20 protons that number alters
more than 20 protons that number alters
more than 20 protons that number alters
a little bit. And so for uh chemistry
a little bit. And so for uh chemistry
a little bit. And so for uh chemistry
specifically atoms you have 1.5 neutrons
specifically atoms you have 1.5 neutrons
specifically atoms you have 1.5 neutrons
to every one proton. That gives you your
to every one proton. That gives you your
to every one proton. That gives you your
most stable atom. So that's how I think
most stable atom. So that's how I think
most stable atom. So that's how I think
about it. Where does the island of

a hydrogen makes a molecule H2. A lot of
oxygen, not nitrogen. We breathe O2 and
oxygen, not nitrogen. We breathe O2 and
oxygen, not nitrogen. We breathe O2 and

set it up and then the adult would
set it up and then the adult would
set it up and then the adult would
actually trigger the reaction. So, it's
actually trigger the reaction. So, it's
actually trigger the reaction. So, it's
very simple. You just need a paint can,
very simple. You just need a paint can,

why doesn't you have to sit it down
why doesn't you have to sit it down
why doesn't you have to sit it down
afterwards, right? You can't hold that

Yeah, good point. Well, how do you know
Yeah, good point. Well, how do you know
Yeah, good point. Well, how do you know
when it's about to blow up? It happens
when it's about to blow up? It happens
when it's about to blow up? It happens
very fast. So, what I do is I go shake,
very fast. So, what I do is I go shake,
very fast. So, what I do is I go shake,
shake, shake, and I slam it down on the
shake, shake, and I slam it down on the
shake, shake, and I slam it down on the
table and then I step back and then I
table and then I step back and then I
table and then I step back and then I
move on to my next one. And while I'm
move on to my next one. And while I'm
move on to my next one. And while I'm
shaking my second one, the first one
shaking my second one, the first one

So why doesn't So I thought paint can
So why doesn't So I thought paint can
So why doesn't So I thought paint can
lids were stronger than that. You know,
lids were stronger than that. You know,
lids were stronger than that. You know,
I think paint can lids are tight,
I think paint can lids are tight,
I think paint can lids are tight,
especially if you mallet it shut, but
especially if you mallet it shut, but
especially if you mallet it shut, but
apparently not. It's no match for CO2.
apparently not. It's no match for CO2.
apparently not. It's no match for CO2.
Exactly. Cuz it's not secured. It's not
Exactly. Cuz it's not secured. It's not
Exactly. Cuz it's not secured. It's not
locked in. And so it's not clamped.
locked in. And so it's not clamped.
locked in. And so it's not clamped.
Exactly. So if you have all those CO2
Exactly. So if you have all those CO2
Exactly. So if you have all those CO2

it will shoot it straight up in the air.
it will shoot it straight up in the air.
it will shoot it straight up in the air.
It's very fun. Wow. I love that one. And
It's very fun. Wow. I love that one. And
It's very fun. Wow. I love that one. And
that happens in seconds. Yeah. And the
that happens in seconds. Yeah. And the
that happens in seconds. Yeah. And the
only reason why you put it in a in a
only reason why you put it in a in a
only reason why you put it in a in a
small plastic cup is to keep it separate
small plastic cup is to keep it separate
small plastic cup is to keep it separate
long enough to hit the lid. Exactly.
long enough to hit the lid. Exactly.
long enough to hit the lid. Exactly.
Because otherwise you it will escape.
Because otherwise you it will escape.
Because otherwise you it will escape.
All all the expanding gas will escape
All all the expanding gas will escape
All all the expanding gas will escape
before you get to mallet it down. So
before you get to mallet it down. So
before you get to mallet it down. So
when you nestle it in like that, you
when you nestle it in like that, you
when you nestle it in like that, you
keep everything separate. You mallet it
keep everything separate. You mallet it
keep everything separate. You mallet it
down. Now you mix it. Bang. And and you
down. Now you mix it. Bang. And and you
down. Now you mix it. Bang. And and you
throw it up first. So the liquid's going
throw it up first. So the liquid's going
throw it up first. So the liquid's going
to go up and then it all slams down at
to go up and then it all slams down at
to go up and then it all slams down at
one time. And so when you shake it, it
one time. And so when you shake it, it
one time. And so when you shake it, it
actually really nicely distributes the

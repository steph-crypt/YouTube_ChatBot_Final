goes<00:03:02.879><c> through</c><00:03:03.040><c> it.</c><00:03:03.519><c> So</c><00:03:03.680><c> those</c><00:03:03.840><c> are</c><00:03:04.000><c> gravity</c>

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
goes through it. So those are gravity
 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.550 align:start position:0%
goes through it. So those are gravity
waves<00:03:05.040><c> that</c><00:03:05.200><c> they</c><00:03:05.440><c> call.</c><00:03:05.680><c> So</c><00:03:05.920><c> we</c><00:03:06.159><c> have</c><00:03:06.239><c> to</c><00:03:06.400><c> make</c>

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
waves that they call. So we have to make
 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.910 align:start position:0%
waves that they call. So we have to make
sure<00:03:06.720><c> that</c><00:03:07.200><c> the</c><00:03:07.599><c> the</c><00:03:07.920><c> kingdom</c><00:03:08.239><c> is</c><00:03:08.400><c> is</c>

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 align:start position:0%

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.710 align:start position:0%
sure that the the kingdom is is

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 align:start position:0%

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.270 align:start position:0%
separated. Okay. the the lexographic
nice<00:03:14.720><c> the</c><00:03:15.040><c> the</c><00:03:15.480><c> lexographic</c><00:03:16.480><c> reference</c><00:03:17.040><c> has</c>

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
nice the the lexographic reference has
 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.589 align:start position:0%
nice the the lexographic reference has
to<00:03:17.440><c> be</c><00:03:17.680><c> correct</c><00:03:18.080><c> distinct.</c><00:03:18.640><c> So</c><00:03:19.040><c> gravitational</c>

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
to be correct distinct. So gravitational
 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.670 align:start position:0%
to be correct distinct. So gravitational
waves.<00:03:19.920><c> So</c><00:03:20.159><c> okay</c><00:03:20.640><c> uh</c><00:03:20.800><c> we</c><00:03:20.959><c> detect</c><00:03:21.280><c> them</c><00:03:21.519><c> when</c>

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
waves. So okay uh we detect them when
 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.910 align:start position:0%
waves. So okay uh we detect them when
they<00:03:21.840><c> wash</c><00:03:22.159><c> over</c><00:03:22.400><c> us,</c><00:03:23.200><c> right?</c><00:03:23.519><c> That's</c><00:03:23.760><c> what</c>

clock you can set a clock by it. Okay.
 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.629 align:start position:0%
clock you can set a clock by it. Okay.
If<00:05:11.600><c> a</c><00:05:11.759><c> gravitational</c><00:05:12.320><c> wave</c><00:05:12.800><c> passes</c><00:05:13.759><c> by</c><00:05:14.000><c> it,</c>

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 align:start position:0%
If a gravitational wave passes by it,
 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:17.749 align:start position:0%
If a gravitational wave passes by it,
right,<00:05:15.600><c> there's</c><00:05:15.840><c> a</c><00:05:16.160><c> change</c><00:05:16.720><c> in</c><00:05:16.960><c> the</c><00:05:17.199><c> rate,</c>

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:17.759 align:start position:0%
right, there's a change in the rate,
 

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:20.150 align:start position:0%
right, there's a change in the rate,
right?<00:05:18.080><c> You'll</c><00:05:18.400><c> see</c><00:05:18.720><c> the</c><00:05:19.120><c> the</c><00:05:19.520><c> rhythm</c><00:05:19.759><c> change.</c>

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
right? You'll see the the rhythm change.
 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.870 align:start position:0%
right? You'll see the the rhythm change.
The<00:05:20.320><c> rhythm</c><00:05:20.639><c> change</c><00:05:20.960><c> just</c><00:05:21.199><c> briefly.</c><00:05:21.919><c> Yes.</c><00:05:22.639><c> And</c>

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
The rhythm change just briefly. Yes. And
 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.990 align:start position:0%
The rhythm change just briefly. Yes. And
so<00:05:23.759><c> the</c><00:05:24.080><c> idea</c><00:05:24.479><c> is</c><00:05:24.960><c> you</c><00:05:25.280><c> monitor</c><00:05:25.680><c> all</c><00:05:25.840><c> the</c>

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
so the idea is you monitor all the
 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.710 align:start position:0%
so the idea is you monitor all the
pulsars.<00:05:26.720><c> You</c><00:05:26.800><c> get</c><00:05:26.960><c> their</c><00:05:27.199><c> rhythms</c><00:05:27.919><c> known,</c>

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
pulsars. You get their rhythms known,
 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.749 align:start position:0%
pulsars. You get their rhythms known,
right?<00:05:29.199><c> And</c><00:05:29.440><c> then</c><00:05:30.320><c> you</c><00:05:30.560><c> see</c><00:05:30.800><c> one</c><00:05:31.039><c> change</c><00:05:31.520><c> and</c>

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:31.759 align:start position:0%
right? And then you see one change and
 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:33.270 align:start position:0%
right? And then you see one change and
then<00:05:31.840><c> you</c><00:05:32.000><c> look</c><00:05:32.160><c> to</c><00:05:32.320><c> see</c><00:05:32.479><c> if</c><00:05:32.639><c> it</c><00:05:32.880><c> is</c><00:05:32.960><c> there</c><00:05:33.120><c> if</c>

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
then you look to see if it is there if
 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.590 align:start position:0%
then you look to see if it is there if
it<00:05:33.360><c> coincides</c><00:05:33.919><c> with</c><00:05:34.000><c> a</c><00:05:34.240><c> gravitational</c><00:05:34.800><c> wave.</c>

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 align:start position:0%
it coincides with a gravitational wave.
 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.670 align:start position:0%
it coincides with a gravitational wave.
Well,<00:05:35.840><c> well,</c><00:05:36.160><c> that</c><00:05:36.320><c> would</c><00:05:36.479><c> be</c><00:05:36.560><c> the</c><00:05:36.720><c> evidence.</c>

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
Well, well, that would be the evidence.
 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.029 align:start position:0%
Well, well, that would be the evidence.
Now<00:05:37.840><c> you</c><00:05:38.000><c> see</c><00:05:38.080><c> if</c><00:05:38.240><c> it</c><00:05:38.320><c> moves</c><00:05:38.560><c> to</c><00:05:38.720><c> the</c><00:05:38.800><c> next</c><00:05:38.880><c> one</c>

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:39.039 align:start position:0%
Now you see if it moves to the next one
 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:40.469 align:start position:0%
Now you see if it moves to the next one
and<00:05:39.199><c> then</c><00:05:39.360><c> the</c><00:05:39.440><c> next</c><00:05:39.600><c> one.</c><00:05:39.759><c> All</c><00:05:39.919><c> right.</c><00:05:40.320><c> And</c>

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 align:start position:0%
and then the next one. All right. And
 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:42.390 align:start position:0%
and then the next one. All right. And
now<00:05:40.800><c> you</c><00:05:41.039><c> would</c><00:05:41.199><c> see</c><00:05:41.360><c> the</c><00:05:41.520><c> consistency</c><00:05:42.160><c> across</c>

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
now you would see the consistency across
 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.150 align:start position:0%
now you would see the consistency across

I want to save money there, right? But
 

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.830 align:start position:0%
I want to save money there, right? But
then<00:08:07.599><c> what</c><00:08:08.160><c> total</c><00:08:08.879><c> impact</c><00:08:09.280><c> is</c><00:08:09.440><c> that</c><00:08:09.599><c> going</c><00:08:09.680><c> to</c>

then what total impact is that going to
 

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.350 align:start position:0%
then what total impact is that going to

that's<00:08:11.680><c> going</c><00:08:11.759><c> on,</c><00:08:12.160><c> right?</c><00:08:12.479><c> It's</c><00:08:12.720><c> not</c><00:08:12.879><c> a</c><00:08:13.120><c> very</c>

00:08:13.589 --> 00:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
that's going on, right? It's not a very
 

00:08:13.599 --> 00:08:16.510 align:start position:0%
that's going on, right? It's not a very

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:16.520 align:start position:0%
efficient means of cost cutting. Yeah.
 

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.990 align:start position:0%
efficient means of cost cutting. Yeah.
So<00:08:17.520><c> if</c><00:08:17.759><c> you</c><00:08:17.919><c> have</c><00:08:18.080><c> a</c><00:08:18.319><c> department</c><00:08:18.639><c> of</c>

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:19.000 align:start position:0%
So if you have a department of
 

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.029 align:start position:0%
So if you have a department of
efficiency,<00:08:20.000><c> it</c><00:08:20.240><c> could</c><00:08:20.400><c> be</c><00:08:20.560><c> more</c><00:08:20.720><c> efficient</c>

00:08:21.029 --> 00:08:21.039 align:start position:0%

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
Right. I think we need to be efficient
 

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.029 align:start position:0%
Right. I think we need to be efficient
with<00:08:26.000><c> the</c><00:08:26.160><c> department</c><00:08:26.479><c> of</c><00:08:26.639><c> efficiency.</c>

shrink. It just has to be closed. But if
it's<00:10:35.519><c> closed,</c><00:10:35.760><c> it</c><00:10:36.000><c> will</c><00:10:36.160><c> shrink.</c>

00:10:38.269 --> 00:10:38.279 align:start position:0%
it's closed, it will shrink.
 

00:10:38.279 --> 00:10:40.230 align:start position:0%
it's closed, it will shrink.
H<00:10:39.279><c> don't</c><00:10:39.519><c> look</c><00:10:39.680><c> at</c><00:10:39.760><c> me.</c><00:10:39.839><c> I'm</c><00:10:40.079><c> not</c><00:10:40.160><c> an</c>

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.190 align:start position:0%
 
So<00:10:45.360><c> the</c><00:10:45.680><c> cosmic</c><00:10:46.079><c> microwave</c><00:10:46.560><c> background,</c>

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:47.200 align:start position:0%
So the cosmic microwave background,
 

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.110 align:start position:0%
So the cosmic microwave background,
right?<00:10:47.600><c> We</c><00:10:47.839><c> have</c><00:10:48.079><c> done</c><00:10:48.240><c> some</c><00:10:48.399><c> experiments</c><00:10:48.880><c> to</c>

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
right? We have done some experiments to
 

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.350 align:start position:0%
right? We have done some experiments to
test<00:10:49.279><c> for</c><00:10:49.440><c> this.</c><00:10:49.920><c> Oh,</c><00:10:50.480><c> so</c><00:10:50.720><c> the</c><00:10:50.959><c> micro</c>

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
test for this. Oh, so the micro
 

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.949 align:start position:0%
test for this. Oh, so the micro
background<00:10:51.600><c> is</c><00:10:51.760><c> in</c><00:10:51.920><c> every</c><00:10:52.079><c> direction,</c><00:10:52.560><c> right?</c>

00:10:52.949 --> 00:10:52.959 align:start position:0%
background is in every direction, right?
 

00:10:52.959 --> 00:10:55.870 align:start position:0%
background is in every direction, right?
So<00:10:53.200><c> if</c><00:10:53.440><c> you</c><00:10:53.600><c> look</c><00:10:53.839><c> this</c><00:10:54.079><c> way</c><00:10:54.720><c> and</c><00:10:54.959><c> you</c><00:10:55.120><c> get</c><00:10:55.279><c> an</c>

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:55.880 align:start position:0%
So if you look this way and you get an
 

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.790 align:start position:0%
So if you look this way and you get an
exact<00:10:56.880><c> I</c><00:10:57.120><c> know</c><00:10:57.279><c> exactly</c><00:10:58.079><c> the</c><00:10:58.320><c> patterning</c>

00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:58.800 align:start position:0%

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.949 align:start position:0%
exact I know exactly the patterning
that's<00:10:59.040><c> happening</c><00:10:59.279><c> there.</c><00:10:59.839><c> Mhm.</c><00:11:00.640><c> And</c><00:11:00.800><c> then</c>

00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:00.959 align:start position:0%
that's happening there. Mhm. And then
 

00:11:00.959 --> 00:11:03.910 align:start position:0%
that's happening there. Mhm. And then
you<00:11:01.200><c> just</c>

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
you just
 

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:06.470 align:start position:0%
you just
look<00:11:04.079><c> that</c><00:11:04.240><c> way,</c><00:11:04.480><c> turn</c><00:11:04.640><c> around,</c><00:11:05.440><c> right?</c><00:11:06.240><c> Is</c>

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
look that way, turn around, right? Is
 

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.230 align:start position:0%
look that way, turn around, right? Is
that<00:11:06.720><c> exact</c><00:11:06.959><c> pattern</c><00:11:07.519><c> pattern?</c><00:11:07.920><c> If</c><00:11:08.079><c> because</c>

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:08.240 align:start position:0%
that exact pattern pattern? If because
 

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.590 align:start position:0%
that exact pattern pattern? If because
if<00:11:08.399><c> that's</c><00:11:08.560><c> the</c><00:11:08.720><c> thing,</c><00:11:08.959><c> then</c><00:11:09.200><c> that</c><00:11:09.440><c> means</c>

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
if that's the thing, then that means
 

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.310 align:start position:0%
if that's the thing, then that means
they<00:11:09.839><c> are</c><00:11:10.000><c> the</c><00:11:10.240><c> same</c><00:11:10.560><c> place,</c><00:11:11.120><c> right?</c><00:11:12.079><c> That</c>

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
they are the same place, right? That
 

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.230 align:start position:0%
they are the same place, right? That
means<00:11:12.560><c> that</c><00:11:12.959><c> was</c><00:11:13.120><c> a</c><00:11:13.360><c> line</c><00:11:13.600><c> that</c><00:11:13.839><c> went</c><00:11:14.000><c> around</c>

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:14.240 align:start position:0%
means that was a line that went around
 

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.630 align:start position:0%
means that was a line that went around
and<00:11:14.480><c> met</c><00:11:14.720><c> on</c><00:11:14.880><c> the</c><00:11:14.959><c> other</c><00:11:15.120><c> side,</c><00:11:15.680><c> right?</c><00:11:16.160><c> Okay.</c>

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
and met on the other side, right? Okay.
 

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.670 align:start position:0%
and met on the other side, right? Okay.
We<00:11:16.880><c> haven't</c><00:11:17.120><c> found</c><00:11:17.360><c> that.</c><00:11:18.079><c> We</c><00:11:18.399><c> haven't.</c><00:11:18.800><c> No,</c>

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.829 align:start position:0%
We haven't found that. We haven't. No,

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.670 align:start position:0%
I think they were. Anyway, uh, he says,
"Hello,<00:11:57.200><c> gentlemen."</c><00:11:57.839><c> And</c><00:11:58.000><c> is</c><00:11:58.160><c> he</c><00:11:59.040><c> Dr.</c>

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
No depth. No depth. And then I have
 

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.670 align:start position:0%
No depth. No depth. And then I have
another<00:13:52.000><c> surface</c><00:13:52.320><c> of</c><00:13:52.480><c> a</c><00:13:52.639><c> table.</c><00:13:52.959><c> So</c><00:13:53.200><c> I</c><00:13:53.360><c> I</c><00:13:53.600><c> can</c>

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:53.680 align:start position:0%

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:55.430 align:start position:0%
another surface of a table. So I I can
make<00:13:53.839><c> that</c><00:13:54.000><c> table</c><00:13:54.240><c> infinite.</c><00:13:55.120><c> Right.</c>

00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
make that table infinite. Right.
 

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.910 align:start position:0%
make that table infinite. Right.
Correct.<00:13:55.920><c> Now</c><00:13:56.160><c> I</c><00:13:56.320><c> can</c><00:13:56.480><c> have</c><00:13:56.639><c> another</c><00:13:56.959><c> table</c>

00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:57.920 align:start position:0%

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.230 align:start position:0%
would never do that. He's paid to read
them<00:19:00.559><c> in</c><00:19:00.720><c> advance.</c><00:19:01.280><c> Oh,</c><00:19:01.360><c> I</c><00:19:01.440><c> see.</c><00:19:01.679><c> Let</c><00:19:01.840><c> that</c><00:19:02.000><c> let</c>

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:02.240 align:start position:0%

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:05.430 align:start position:0%

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:07.830 align:start position:0%
the record show. Exactly.
Okay.<00:19:05.760><c> So,</c><00:19:05.919><c> now</c><00:19:06.640><c> I</c><00:19:06.880><c> forgot</c><00:19:07.039><c> the</c><00:19:07.200><c> question.</c><00:19:07.679><c> So,</c>

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
Okay. So, now I forgot the question. So,
 

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:10.630 align:start position:0%
Okay. So, now I forgot the question. So,
he's<00:19:08.080><c> basically</c><00:19:08.640><c> saying</c><00:19:09.200><c> like</c><00:19:10.080><c> if</c><00:19:10.320><c> we</c><00:19:10.480><c> can</c>

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
he's basically saying like if we can
 

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:13.110 align:start position:0%
he's basically saying like if we can
never<00:19:10.880><c> touch</c><00:19:11.120><c> anything</c><00:19:11.600><c> truly,</c><00:19:12.559><c> then</c><00:19:12.960><c> could</c>

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
never touch anything truly, then could
 

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:15.669 align:start position:0%
never touch anything truly, then could
it<00:19:13.280><c> be</c><00:19:13.440><c> dark</c><00:19:13.760><c> matter</c><00:19:14.720><c> in</c><00:19:14.960><c> between</c><00:19:15.360><c> the</c>

00:19:15.669 --> 00:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
it be dark matter in between the
 

00:19:15.679 --> 00:19:17.750 align:start position:0%
it be dark matter in between the
touching<00:19:16.320><c> that's</c><00:19:16.640><c> pushing</c><00:19:16.960><c> or</c><00:19:17.280><c> pulling?</c><00:19:17.760><c> All</c>

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
touching that's pushing or pulling? All
 

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:21.909 align:start position:0%
touching that's pushing or pulling? All
right.<00:19:18.320><c> So,</c><00:19:18.640><c> it</c><00:19:18.960><c> turns</c><00:19:19.120><c> out</c><00:19:20.080><c> dark</c><00:19:20.400><c> matter</c>

00:19:21.909 --> 00:19:21.919 align:start position:0%
right. So, it turns out dark matter
 

00:19:21.919 --> 00:19:26.549 align:start position:0%
right. So, it turns out dark matter
does<00:19:22.280><c> not</c><00:19:23.280><c> interact</c><00:19:23.919><c> with</c><00:19:24.600><c> itself</c><00:19:25.600><c> as</c>

00:19:26.549 --> 00:19:26.559 align:start position:0%
does not interact with itself as
 

00:19:26.559 --> 00:19:28.710 align:start position:0%
does not interact with itself as
potently<00:19:27.120><c> as</c><00:19:27.440><c> regular</c><00:19:27.840><c> matter</c><00:19:28.160><c> does.</c>

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:28.720 align:start position:0%
potently as regular matter does.
 

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:31.430 align:start position:0%
potently as regular matter does.
Interesting.<00:19:29.520><c> Okay.</c><00:19:30.320><c> So</c><00:19:30.799><c> when</c><00:19:31.120><c> regular</c>

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
Interesting. Okay. So when regular
 

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:33.510 align:start position:0%
Interesting. Okay. So when regular
matter<00:19:31.760><c> gets</c><00:19:32.000><c> together,</c><00:19:32.559><c> right,</c><00:19:33.200><c> it's</c>

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
matter gets together, right, it's
 

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.630 align:start position:0%
matter gets together, right, it's
molecules<00:19:34.080><c> grab</c><00:19:34.400><c> on.</c><00:19:34.799><c> You</c><00:19:35.039><c> make</c><00:19:35.200><c> solid</c>

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
molecules grab on. You make solid
 

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:39.590 align:start position:0%
molecules grab on. You make solid
objects,<00:19:36.640><c> liquid,</c><00:19:37.120><c> gas.</c><00:19:37.600><c> It</c><00:19:38.120><c> it'll</c><00:19:39.120><c> it'll</c>

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
objects, liquid, gas. It it'll it'll
 

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.909 align:start position:0%
objects, liquid, gas. It it'll it'll
make<00:19:40.000><c> Okay,</c><00:19:40.400><c> you</c><00:19:40.720><c> So</c><00:19:40.880><c> we</c><00:19:41.039><c> have</c><00:19:41.200><c> regular</c><00:19:41.520><c> matter</c>

00:19:41.909 --> 00:19:41.919 align:start position:0%
make Okay, you So we have regular matter
 

00:19:41.919 --> 00:19:45.110 align:start position:0%
make Okay, you So we have regular matter
planets,<00:19:42.559><c> right?</c><00:19:43.280><c> We</c><00:19:43.520><c> have</c><00:19:43.880><c> rocks</c><00:19:44.880><c> because</c>

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
planets, right? We have rocks because
 

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:47.110 align:start position:0%
planets, right? We have rocks because
that's<00:19:45.280><c> what</c><00:19:45.520><c> regular</c><00:19:45.840><c> matter</c><00:19:46.240><c> does</c><00:19:46.880><c> using</c>

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
that's what regular matter does using
 

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:49.110 align:start position:0%
that's what regular matter does using

Okay? So, it doesn't interact with us
 

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.470 align:start position:0%
Okay? So, it doesn't interact with us

because<00:23:07.039><c> that's</c><00:23:07.200><c> what</c><00:23:07.360><c> the</c><00:23:07.520><c> sun</c><00:23:07.679><c> is</c><00:23:07.840><c> made</c><00:23:07.919><c> of.</c>

00:23:08.149 --> 00:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
because that's what the sun is made of.
 

00:23:08.159 --> 00:23:09.510 align:start position:0%
because that's what the sun is made of.
That's<00:23:08.320><c> what</c><00:23:08.480><c> Jupiter's</c><00:23:08.960><c> Jupiter</c><00:23:09.360><c> didn't</c>

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
That's what Jupiter's Jupiter didn't
 

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:11.350 align:start position:0%
That's what Jupiter's Jupiter didn't
give<00:23:09.679><c> up</c><00:23:09.840><c> any</c><00:23:10.000><c> mass</c><00:23:10.320><c> that</c><00:23:10.480><c> it</c><00:23:10.640><c> was</c><00:23:10.720><c> born</c><00:23:10.960><c> with.</c>

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
give up any mass that it was born with.
 

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:12.870 align:start position:0%
give up any mass that it was born with.
So,<00:23:11.520><c> you</c><00:23:11.679><c> look</c><00:23:11.840><c> at</c><00:23:11.919><c> the</c><00:23:12.159><c> composition</c><00:23:12.640><c> on</c>

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
So, you look at the composition on
 

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:15.990 align:start position:0%
So, you look at the composition on
Jupiter,<00:23:13.679><c> it</c><00:23:13.919><c> matches</c><00:23:14.240><c> that</c><00:23:14.480><c> of</c><00:23:14.640><c> the</c><00:23:14.799><c> sun.</c>

00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
Jupiter, it matches that of the sun.
 

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.909 align:start position:0%
Jupiter, it matches that of the sun.

So,<00:23:22.000><c> Jupiter</c><00:23:22.400><c> was</c><00:23:22.559><c> trying</c><00:23:22.720><c> to</c><00:23:22.880><c> be</c><00:23:23.039><c> the</c><00:23:23.200><c> sun.</c>

00:23:23.909 --> 00:23:23.919 align:start position:0%
So, Jupiter was trying to be the sun.
 

00:23:23.919 --> 00:23:25.590 align:start position:0%
So, Jupiter was trying to be the sun.
It's<00:23:24.159><c> true.</c><00:23:24.640><c> That's</c><00:23:24.880><c> what</c><00:23:25.039><c> Jupiter</c><00:23:25.440><c> was</c>

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
It's true. That's what Jupiter was
 

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.590 align:start position:0%
It's true. That's what Jupiter was
trying.<00:23:25.919><c> Jupiter</c><00:23:26.240><c> was</c><00:23:26.400><c> just</c><00:23:26.640><c> like,</c><00:23:27.039><c> I'mma</c><00:23:27.440><c> get</c>

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:41.110 align:start position:0%
wannabe it was. That's how wannabe sun

Go<00:23:42.720><c> ahead.</c><00:23:42.960><c> So,</c><00:23:43.120><c> I</c><00:23:43.200><c> go</c><00:23:43.280><c> to</c><00:23:43.440><c> the</c><00:23:43.520><c> periodic</c><00:23:44.000><c> table</c>

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
Go ahead. So, I go to the periodic table
 

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.669 align:start position:0%
Go ahead. So, I go to the periodic table
and<00:23:44.400><c> I</c><00:23:44.480><c> say</c><00:23:44.640><c> of</c><00:23:44.799><c> all</c><00:23:44.960><c> these</c><00:23:45.120><c> elements,</c><00:23:45.520><c> some</c>

00:23:45.669 --> 00:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
and I say of all these elements, some
 

00:23:45.679 --> 00:23:47.830 align:start position:0%
and I say of all these elements, some
are<00:23:45.840><c> very</c><00:23:46.000><c> rare,</c><00:23:46.720><c> some</c><00:23:46.960><c> are</c><00:23:47.120><c> not</c><00:23:47.440><c> basically</c>

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
are very rare, some are not basically
 

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.430 align:start position:0%
are very rare, some are not basically
not<00:23:48.000><c> really</c><00:23:48.240><c> in</c><00:23:48.400><c> the</c><00:23:48.480><c> solar</c><00:23:48.799><c> system.</c><00:23:49.200><c> So,</c><00:23:49.280><c> I'm</c>

00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
not really in the solar system. So, I'm
 

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:51.029 align:start position:0%
not really in the solar system. So, I'm
going<00:23:49.520><c> to</c><00:23:49.679><c> ignore</c><00:23:50.000><c> those.</c><00:23:50.400><c> and</c><00:23:50.640><c> which</c><00:23:50.880><c> are</c>

00:23:51.029 --> 00:23:51.039 align:start position:0%
going to ignore those. and which are
 

00:23:51.039 --> 00:23:55.190 align:start position:0%
going to ignore those. and which are
common<00:23:51.600><c> and</c><00:23:51.760><c> and</c><00:23:52.159><c> so</c><00:23:53.120><c> nickel,</c><00:23:53.960><c> iron,</c><00:23:54.960><c> these</c>

00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
common and and so nickel, iron, these
 

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.230 align:start position:0%
common and and so nickel, iron, these
are<00:23:55.360><c> pretty</c><00:23:55.600><c> common</c><00:23:56.400><c> in</c><00:23:56.559><c> the</c>

00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
are pretty common in the
 

00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:01.390 align:start position:0%
are pretty common in the
universe.<00:23:58.240><c> So</c><00:23:58.919><c> maybe</c><00:23:59.919><c> I</c><00:24:00.240><c> get</c><00:24:00.480><c> the</c><00:24:00.720><c> mass</c><00:24:01.120><c> of</c>

00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:01.400 align:start position:0%
universe. So maybe I get the mass of
 

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:04.149 align:start position:0%
universe. So maybe I get the mass of
Mercury<00:24:02.400><c> fitting</c><00:24:02.799><c> into</c><00:24:03.039><c> that</c><00:24:03.280><c> volume</c><00:24:03.840><c> by</c>

00:24:04.149 --> 00:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
Mercury fitting into that volume by
 

00:24:04.159 --> 00:24:06.230 align:start position:0%
Mercury fitting into that volume by
throwing<00:24:04.480><c> in</c><00:24:04.720><c> something</c><00:24:05.039><c> heavier</c><00:24:05.440><c> than</c><00:24:05.600><c> rock</c>

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
throwing in something heavier than rock
 

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.750 align:start position:0%
throwing in something heavier than rock
because<00:24:06.400><c> we</c><00:24:06.559><c> know</c><00:24:06.720><c> it's</c><00:24:06.880><c> rock</c><00:24:07.120><c> on</c><00:24:07.280><c> the</c><00:24:07.360><c> surface</c>

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
because we know it's rock on the surface
 

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:09.270 align:start position:0%
because we know it's rock on the surface
because<00:24:07.919><c> we</c><00:24:08.080><c> see</c><00:24:08.240><c> the</c><00:24:08.400><c> cratering</c><00:24:08.960><c> looks</c><00:24:09.200><c> just</c>

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:09.280 align:start position:0%
because we see the cratering looks just
 

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:11.510 align:start position:0%
because we see the cratering looks just
like<00:24:09.440><c> the</c><00:24:09.600><c> surface</c><00:24:09.840><c> of</c><00:24:09.919><c> the</c><00:24:10.080><c> moon.</c><00:24:10.559><c> Okay,</c><00:24:11.200><c> so</c>

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
like the surface of the moon. Okay, so
 

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:13.350 align:start position:0%
like the surface of the moon. Okay, so
but<00:24:11.840><c> deep</c><00:24:12.080><c> inside</c><00:24:12.480><c> what</c><00:24:12.640><c> could</c><00:24:12.799><c> be</c><00:24:12.880><c> there.</c><00:24:13.120><c> Now</c>

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
but deep inside what could be there. Now
 

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:15.029 align:start position:0%
but deep inside what could be there. Now
we<00:24:13.440><c> know</c><00:24:13.600><c> when</c><00:24:13.760><c> it</c><00:24:13.919><c> formed</c><00:24:14.320><c> heavy</c><00:24:14.640><c> stuff</c><00:24:14.880><c> goes</c>

00:24:15.029 --> 00:24:15.039 align:start position:0%
we know when it formed heavy stuff goes

Okay.<00:24:23.840><c> So,</c><00:24:24.559><c> we</c><00:24:24.799><c> ask</c><00:24:25.039><c> ourselves,</c><00:24:25.600><c> how</c><00:24:25.840><c> much</c>

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
Okay. So, we ask ourselves, how much
 

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.190 align:start position:0%
Okay. So, we ask ourselves, how much
iron<00:24:26.400><c> has</c><00:24:26.640><c> to</c><00:24:26.799><c> be</c><00:24:26.960><c> there</c><00:24:27.760><c> to</c><00:24:28.000><c> give</c><00:24:28.159><c> us</c><00:24:28.480><c> that</c>

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
iron has to be there to give us that
 

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:31.909 align:start position:0%
iron has to be there to give us that
mass<00:24:29.600><c> to</c><00:24:29.760><c> get</c><00:24:30.000><c> that</c><00:24:30.320><c> mass</c><00:24:31.039><c> at</c><00:24:31.279><c> that</c><00:24:31.520><c> size,</c>

00:24:31.909 --> 00:24:31.919 align:start position:0%
mass to get that mass at that size,
 

00:24:31.919 --> 00:24:33.590 align:start position:0%
mass to get that mass at that size,
which<00:24:32.159><c> is</c><00:24:32.320><c> basically</c><00:24:32.559><c> the</c><00:24:32.799><c> density,</c><00:24:33.279><c> right?</c>

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
which is basically the density, right?
 

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:35.590 align:start position:0%
which is basically the density, right?
So,<00:24:33.760><c> the</c><00:24:34.000><c> average</c><00:24:34.320><c> density,</c><00:24:34.880><c> we</c><00:24:35.120><c> construct</c>

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
So, the average density, we construct
 

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.510 align:start position:0%
So, the average density, we construct
the<00:24:35.840><c> average</c><00:24:36.159><c> density</c><00:24:36.480><c> of</c><00:24:36.559><c> the</c><00:24:36.720><c> object</c>

00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
the average density of the object
 

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:39.350 align:start position:0%
the average density of the object
pulling<00:24:37.919><c> from</c><00:24:38.080><c> the</c><00:24:38.240><c> periodic</c><00:24:38.640><c> table</c><00:24:39.120><c> of</c>

elements we know are in the universe.
 

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:43.190 align:start position:0%
elements we know are in the universe.
So,<00:24:41.120><c> we</c><00:24:41.279><c> find</c><00:24:41.440><c> out</c><00:24:41.679><c> it</c><00:24:41.840><c> has</c><00:24:41.919><c> a</c><00:24:42.159><c> huge</c><00:24:42.480><c> core</c><00:24:42.960><c> of</c>

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:56.230 align:start position:0%
Oh, it works the other way, too. Really?
We've<00:24:52.720><c> discovered</c><00:24:53.240><c> asteroids,</c><00:24:54.240><c> okay,</c><00:24:55.200><c> and</c><00:24:56.000><c> we</c>

We've discovered asteroids, okay, and we
 

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:58.149 align:start position:0%
We've discovered asteroids, okay, and we
know<00:24:56.400><c> they're</c><00:24:56.640><c> rocky,</c><00:24:57.360><c> but</c><00:24:57.600><c> we</c><00:24:57.760><c> look</c><00:24:57.840><c> at</c><00:24:58.000><c> the</c>

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:34.870 align:start position:0%
everybody does. So, how do you have rock
that<00:25:33.039><c> has</c><00:25:33.200><c> less</c><00:25:33.440><c> mass</c><00:25:33.679><c> than</c><00:25:33.919><c> rock?</c><00:25:34.480><c> It</c><00:25:34.640><c> ain't</c>

00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:34.880 align:start position:0%

that has less mass than rock? It ain't
rock.<00:25:35.679><c> Well,</c><00:25:36.559><c> well,</c><00:25:36.880><c> it's</c><00:25:37.120><c> got</c><00:25:37.200><c> to</c><00:25:37.279><c> be</c><00:25:37.440><c> made</c>

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:37.600 align:start position:0%

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.909 align:start position:0%
rock. Well, well, it's got to be made
out<00:25:37.760><c> of</c><00:25:37.919><c> stuff</c><00:25:38.080><c> that</c><00:25:38.320><c> we</c><00:25:38.559><c> know</c><00:25:38.720><c> about,</c><00:25:39.279><c> right?</c>

00:25:39.909 --> 00:25:39.919 align:start position:0%
out of stuff that we know about, right?

out of stuff that we know about, right?
So<00:25:40.559><c> that</c><00:25:40.880><c> was</c><00:25:41.120><c> the</c><00:25:41.440><c> first</c><00:25:42.159><c> idea</c><00:25:43.039><c> that</c><00:25:43.440><c> maybe</c>

00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
So that was the first idea that maybe
 

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:46.870 align:start position:0%
So that was the first idea that maybe
some<00:25:44.200><c> asteroids</c><00:25:45.200><c> are</c><00:25:45.440><c> piles</c><00:25:45.919><c> of</c><00:25:46.080><c> rubble.</c>

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:46.880 align:start position:0%

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:50.640 align:start position:0%

00:26:28.149 --> 00:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
Bruce Willis, you messed up bad. So you
 

00:26:28.159 --> 00:26:29.990 align:start position:0%
Bruce Willis, you messed up bad. So you

00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
Mercury might be a little bigger.
 

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:14.390 align:start position:0%
Mercury might be a little bigger.

However, Mercury has four times the mass
 

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:17.430 align:start position:0%
However, Mercury has four times the mass

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:19.430 align:start position:0%

the<00:27:17.520><c> mass.</c><00:27:18.240><c> And</c><00:27:18.400><c> we</c><00:27:18.559><c> know</c><00:27:18.640><c> it's</c><00:27:18.880><c> rocky</c><00:27:19.200><c> on</c><00:27:19.279><c> the</c>

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:19.440 align:start position:0%

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.590 align:start position:0%

00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
what's going on? We know the moon has
 

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:27.990 align:start position:0%
what's going on? We know the moon has
hardly<00:27:25.840><c> any</c><00:27:26.080><c> iron,</c><00:27:27.200><c> right?</c><00:27:27.600><c> Because</c><00:27:27.760><c> it</c><00:27:27.919><c> was</c>

00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
hardly any iron, right? Because it was
 

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.230 align:start position:0%
hardly any iron, right? Because it was

00:27:36.549 --> 00:27:36.559 align:start position:0%
That's the moon. The moon is crusty. So
 

00:27:36.559 --> 00:27:38.269 align:start position:0%
That's the moon. The moon is crusty. So
we<00:27:36.880><c> think</c>

This<00:30:08.159><c> is</c><00:30:08.320><c> like</c><00:30:08.480><c> the</c><00:30:08.760><c> 1930s</c><00:30:09.760><c> and</c><00:30:10.080><c> I</c><00:30:10.240><c> think</c><00:30:10.320><c> it</c>

00:30:10.389 --> 00:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
This is like the 1930s and I think it

00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:52.960 align:start position:0%

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:55.990 align:start position:0%
because Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah.
Yeah.<00:30:53.200><c> And</c><00:30:53.440><c> he</c><00:30:53.600><c> predicted</c><00:30:54.880><c> gravity</c><00:30:55.279><c> waves</c><00:30:55.840><c> I</c>

00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
Yeah. And he predicted gravity waves I
 

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.830 align:start position:0%
Yeah. And he predicted gravity waves I
mean<00:30:56.159><c> gravitational</c><00:30:56.799><c> waves</c><00:30:57.440><c> which</c><00:30:57.679><c> means</c>

00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
mean gravitational waves which means
 

00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:59.750 align:start position:0%
mean gravitational waves which means
that<00:30:58.000><c> the</c><00:30:58.240><c> math</c><00:30:58.480><c> was</c><00:30:58.720><c> already</c><00:30:59.039><c> there.</c><00:30:59.520><c> Math</c>

00:30:59.750 --> 00:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
that the math was already there. Math
 

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:01.990 align:start position:0%
that the math was already there. Math
was<00:30:59.919><c> already</c><00:31:00.159><c> there.</c><00:31:00.480><c> Right.</c><00:31:00.880><c> Right.</c><00:31:01.200><c> And</c><00:31:01.440><c> so</c>

00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
was already there. Right. Right. And so
 

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.070 align:start position:0%
was already there. Right. Right. And so
so<00:31:02.240><c> math</c><00:31:02.559><c> was</c><00:31:02.720><c> in</c><00:31:02.880><c> place</c><00:31:03.120><c> and</c><00:31:03.360><c> then</c><00:31:03.520><c> we</c><00:31:03.679><c> say</c><00:31:03.919><c> it</c>

00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
so math was in place and then we say it
 

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:07.430 align:start position:0%
so math was in place and then we say it
must<00:31:04.320><c> be</c><00:31:04.559><c> but</c><00:31:04.799><c> he</c><00:31:05.039><c> he</c><00:31:05.440><c> did</c><00:31:05.679><c> not</c><00:31:06.039><c> believe</c><00:31:07.039><c> that</c>

00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
must be but he he did not believe that
 

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:10.510 align:start position:0%
must be but he he did not believe that
matter<00:31:08.080><c> would</c><00:31:08.480><c> do</c><00:31:09.120><c> would</c><00:31:09.520><c> be</c>

00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:10.520 align:start position:0%
matter would do would be
 

00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:13.110 align:start position:0%
matter would do would be
so<00:31:11.520><c> he</c><00:31:11.760><c> didn't</c><00:31:11.919><c> think</c><00:31:12.080><c> the</c><00:31:12.320><c> universe</c><00:31:12.799><c> would</c><00:31:12.960><c> be</c>

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
so he didn't think the universe would be
 

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:16.149 align:start position:0%
so he didn't think the universe would be
that<00:31:13.360><c> mean</c><00:31:13.679><c> to</c><00:31:13.840><c> matter</c><00:31:14.880><c> really.</c><00:31:15.760><c> Yeah.</c>

00:31:16.149 --> 00:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
that mean to matter really. Yeah.
 

00:31:16.159 --> 00:31:18.230 align:start position:0%
that mean to matter really. Yeah.

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:20.070 align:start position:0%

00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:20.080 align:start position:0%

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:21.830 align:start position:0%

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:23.750 align:start position:0%

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:25.190 align:start position:0%
to a singularity. Yes. It doesn't make

00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
any sense. Doesn't make any sense. So he
 

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.029 align:start position:0%
any sense. Doesn't make any sense. So he
said<00:31:25.440><c> it</c><00:31:25.600><c> must</c><00:31:25.760><c> but</c><00:31:25.919><c> it</c><00:31:26.000><c> can't</c><00:31:26.080><c> be.</c><00:31:26.799><c> And</c><00:31:26.880><c> then</c>

00:31:27.029 --> 00:31:27.039 align:start position:0%
said it must but it can't be. And then
 

00:31:27.039 --> 00:31:28.310 align:start position:0%
said it must but it can't be. And then
we<00:31:27.120><c> have</c><00:31:27.279><c> been</c><00:31:27.440><c> up</c><00:31:27.600><c> there</c><00:31:27.760><c> and</c><00:31:27.840><c> fine</c><00:31:28.000><c> and</c><00:31:28.159><c> black</c>

00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
we have been up there and fine and black
 

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:29.909 align:start position:0%
we have been up there and fine and black
holes.<00:31:28.640><c> Look</c><00:31:28.799><c> at</c><00:31:28.880><c> that.</c><00:31:29.039><c> We</c><00:31:29.200><c> got</c><00:31:29.360><c> them.</c><00:31:29.679><c> That's</c>

00:31:29.909 --> 00:31:29.919 align:start position:0%
holes. Look at that. We got them. That's
 

00:31:29.919 --> 00:31:31.909 align:start position:0%
holes. Look at that. We got them. That's
so<00:31:30.080><c> crazy.</c><00:31:30.320><c> So,</c><00:31:30.640><c> so</c><00:31:31.039><c> yes,</c><00:31:31.279><c> it</c><00:31:31.520><c> can</c><00:31:31.679><c> be</c>

00:31:31.909 --> 00:31:31.919 align:start position:0%
so crazy. So, so yes, it can be
 

00:31:31.919 --> 00:31:33.110 align:start position:0%
so crazy. So, so yes, it can be
completely<00:31:32.320><c> described.</c><00:31:32.720><c> And</c><00:31:32.880><c> what's</c>

00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
completely described. And what's
 

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:34.950 align:start position:0%
completely described. And what's
interesting<00:31:33.520><c> about</c><00:31:33.679><c> it</c><00:31:33.919><c> is</c><00:31:34.320><c> the</c><00:31:34.640><c> two</c><00:31:34.799><c> black</c>

00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
interesting about it is the two black
 

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:37.750 align:start position:0%
interesting about it is the two black
holes<00:31:35.360><c> enter</c><00:31:35.679><c> each</c><00:31:35.919><c> other's</c><00:31:36.320><c> event</c><00:31:36.760><c> horizon.</c>

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:39.990 align:start position:0%
holes enter each other's event horizon.
That's<00:31:38.000><c> where</c><00:31:38.159><c> it</c><00:31:38.320><c> gets</c><00:31:38.559><c> fun.</c><00:31:39.039><c> Oh,</c><00:31:39.279><c> really?</c>

00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
That's where it gets fun. Oh, really?
 

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.990 align:start position:0%
That's where it gets fun. Oh, really?
Yeah.<00:31:41.039><c> What</c><00:31:41.399><c> if</c><00:31:42.399><c> there</c><00:31:42.720><c> isn't</c><00:31:43.120><c> a</c><00:31:43.360><c> dominant</c>

00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
Yeah. What if there isn't a dominant
 

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.750 align:start position:0%
Yeah. What if there isn't a dominant

00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:48.760 align:start position:0%

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:52.310 align:start position:0%
black hole? What if they are both mirror
identities?<00:31:49.760><c> What</c><00:31:50.000><c> happens</c><00:31:50.320><c> then?</c><00:31:51.760><c> Oh,</c><00:31:52.000><c> you</c>

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:52.320 align:start position:0%

00:36:49.839 --> 00:36:52.230 align:start position:0%
Okay. And you know how we get it. You

00:36:59.109 --> 00:36:59.119 align:start position:0%
the direction earth is spinning. Now
 

00:36:59.119 --> 00:37:00.630 align:start position:0%

00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:00.640 align:start position:0%
point your thumb up. That's the north
 

00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:03.510 align:start position:0%
point your thumb up. That's the north
pole.<00:37:01.040><c> Yeah.</c><00:37:01.440><c> Look</c><00:37:01.760><c> at</c><00:37:01.920><c> that.</c><00:37:02.640><c> So</c><00:37:02.880><c> that's</c><00:37:03.119><c> it.</c>

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
pole. Yeah. Look at that. So that's it.
 

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:05.109 align:start position:0%
pole. Yeah. Look at that. So that's it.
That's<00:37:03.680><c> it.</c><00:37:03.920><c> But</c><00:37:04.160><c> suppose</c><00:37:04.480><c> most</c><00:37:04.720><c> people</c><00:37:04.880><c> were</c>

00:37:05.109 --> 00:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
That's it. But suppose most people were
 

00:37:05.119 --> 00:37:06.950 align:start position:0%
That's it. But suppose most people were
left-handed<00:37:05.760><c> then.</c><00:37:06.240><c> There's</c><00:37:06.400><c> no</c><00:37:06.560><c> left-hand</c>

00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
left-handed then. There's no left-hand
 

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:08.550 align:start position:0%
left-handed then. There's no left-hand
rule.<00:37:07.200><c> It's</c><00:37:07.359><c> only</c><00:37:07.440><c> a</c><00:37:07.599><c> right-hand</c><00:37:07.839><c> rule.</c><00:37:08.240><c> Okay.</c>

00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
rule. It's only a right-hand rule. Okay.
 

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:10.230 align:start position:0%
rule. It's only a right-hand rule. Okay.
See?<00:37:08.960><c> And</c><00:37:09.200><c> uh</c><00:37:09.280><c> there's</c><00:37:09.520><c> your</c><00:37:09.920><c> plus</c><00:37:10.079><c> most</c>

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
See? And uh there's your plus most
 

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:11.510 align:start position:0%
See? And uh there's your plus most
people<00:37:10.320><c> are</c><00:37:10.480><c> not</c><00:37:10.640><c> left-handed.</c><00:37:11.119><c> That's</c><00:37:11.359><c> my</c>

00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
people are not left-handed. That's my
 

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:13.670 align:start position:0%
people are not left-handed. That's my
point.<00:37:12.320><c> We're</c><00:37:12.640><c> discriminating</c><00:37:13.200><c> against</c><00:37:13.520><c> left</c>

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
point. We're discriminating against left
 

00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:15.870 align:start position:0%
point. We're discriminating against left
hand.<00:37:14.240><c> So</c><00:37:14.320><c> you</c><00:37:14.400><c> think</c><00:37:14.560><c> if</c><00:37:14.720><c> left</c><00:37:14.960><c> people</c>

00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:15.880 align:start position:0%
hand. So you think if left people
 

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:18.069 align:start position:0%
hand. So you think if left people
dominated<00:37:16.880><c> dominantly</c><00:37:17.359><c> left-handed,</c><00:37:17.920><c> we</c>

00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:18.079 align:start position:0%
dominated dominantly left-handed, we
 

00:37:18.079 --> 00:37:19.190 align:start position:0%
dominated dominantly left-handed, we
would<00:37:18.240><c> probably</c><00:37:18.400><c> done</c><00:37:18.560><c> it</c><00:37:18.720><c> the</c><00:37:18.880><c> other</c><00:37:18.960><c> way.</c>

00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
would probably done it the other way.
 

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:20.470 align:start position:0%
would probably done it the other way.
Oh,<00:37:19.440><c> so</c><00:37:19.520><c> then</c><00:37:19.680><c> the</c><00:37:19.760><c> North</c><00:37:20.000><c> Pole</c><00:37:20.240><c> would</c><00:37:20.400><c> have</c>

00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
Oh, so then the North Pole would have
 

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:22.069 align:start position:0%
Oh, so then the North Pole would have
been<00:37:20.640><c> in</c><00:37:20.800><c> the</c><00:37:20.960><c> south.</c><00:37:21.359><c> Yeah.</c><00:37:21.599><c> If</c><00:37:21.680><c> they</c><00:37:21.839><c> did</c><00:37:21.920><c> the</c>

00:37:22.069 --> 00:37:22.079 align:start position:0%
been in the south. Yeah. If they did the
 

00:37:22.079 --> 00:37:24.390 align:start position:0%
been in the south. Yeah. If they did the
left<00:37:22.240><c> hand</c><00:37:22.480><c> rule.</c><00:37:22.880><c> Yeah.</c><00:37:23.200><c> Okay.</c><00:37:23.599><c> Yeah.</c><00:37:24.160><c> You</c><00:37:24.320><c> do</c>

00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
left hand rule. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. You do
 

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:26.790 align:start position:0%
left hand rule. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. You do
that<00:37:24.560><c> for</c><00:37:24.800><c> any</c><00:37:25.040><c> rotating</c><00:37:25.440><c> object.</c><00:37:26.320><c> That's</c><00:37:26.560><c> how</c>

00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
that for any rotating object. That's how
 

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:30.270 align:start position:0%
that for any rotating object. That's how
you<00:37:27.040><c> can</c><00:37:27.200><c> say</c><00:37:27.920><c> that</c><00:37:28.160><c> the</c><00:37:28.400><c> planet</c><00:37:28.800><c> Uranus</c><00:37:29.760><c> is</c>

00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:30.280 align:start position:0%
you can say that the planet Uranus is
 

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:34.150 align:start position:0%
you can say that the planet Uranus is
tipped<00:37:31.280><c> 98</c><00:37:32.240><c> degrees</c><00:37:32.720><c> from</c><00:37:32.880><c> the</c><00:37:33.119><c> vertical.</c><00:37:33.920><c> Oh,</c>

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
tipped 98 degrees from the vertical. Oh,
 

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:36.390 align:start position:0%
tipped 98 degrees from the vertical. Oh,
okay.<00:37:34.800><c> How's</c><00:37:35.119><c> that</c><00:37:35.280><c> possible</c><00:37:35.920><c> if</c><00:37:36.160><c> you</c><00:37:36.240><c> just</c>

00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
okay. How's that possible if you just
 

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.069 align:start position:0%
okay. How's that possible if you just
have<00:37:36.560><c> another</c><00:37:36.800><c> axis</c><00:37:37.200><c> that's</c><00:37:37.520><c> up</c><00:37:37.680><c> there?</c>

00:37:38.069 --> 00:37:38.079 align:start position:0%
have another axis that's up there?
 

00:37:38.079 --> 00:37:40.390 align:start position:0%
have another axis that's up there?
Right.<00:37:38.480><c> Because</c><00:37:38.720><c> the</c><00:37:38.960><c> right</c><00:37:39.200><c> hand</c><00:37:39.440><c> rule</c><00:37:40.240><c> it's</c>

00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
Right. Because the right hand rule it's
 

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:43.030 align:start position:0%
Right. Because the right hand rule it's
the<00:37:40.640><c> space</c><00:37:40.880><c> takes</c><00:37:41.119><c> it</c><00:37:41.359><c> down</c><00:37:42.320><c> down</c><00:37:42.480><c> below.</c>

00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
the space takes it down down below.
 

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:44.950 align:start position:0%
the space takes it down down below.
That's<00:37:43.280><c> so</c><00:37:43.440><c> cool,</c><00:37:43.680><c> man.</c><00:37:44.079><c> Yeah,</c><00:37:44.480><c> that's</c><00:37:44.720><c> very</c>

00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
That's so cool, man. Yeah, that's very
 

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:46.670 align:start position:0%
That's so cool, man. Yeah, that's very
cool.<00:37:45.520><c> That's</c><00:37:45.680><c> how</c><00:37:45.839><c> you</c><00:37:46.000><c> can</c><00:37:46.079><c> have</c><00:37:46.160><c> a</c><00:37:46.320><c> planet</c>

00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
cool. That's how you can have a planet
 

00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:50.230 align:start position:0%
cool. That's how you can have a planet
that's<00:37:47.680><c> 180</c><00:37:48.000><c> degrees</c><00:37:48.800><c> flipped,</c><00:37:49.680><c> right?</c><00:37:50.079><c> Why</c>

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
that's 180 degrees flipped, right? Why
 

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:51.589 align:start position:0%
that's 180 degrees flipped, right? Why
don't<00:37:50.400><c> you</c><00:37:50.480><c> just</c><00:37:50.560><c> say,</c><00:37:50.800><c> well,</c><00:37:51.040><c> just</c><00:37:51.200><c> call</c><00:37:51.359><c> that</c>

00:37:51.589 --> 00:37:51.599 align:start position:0%
don't you just say, well, just call that
 

00:37:51.599 --> 00:37:53.829 align:start position:0%
don't you just say, well, just call that
north.<00:37:52.320><c> No,</c><00:37:52.640><c> because</c><00:37:52.880><c> the</c><00:37:53.119><c> rotation</c>

00:37:53.829 --> 00:37:53.839 align:start position:0%
north. No, because the rotation
 

00:37:53.839 --> 00:37:57.109 align:start position:0%
north. No, because the rotation
rotation.<00:37:54.480><c> Yeah.</c><00:37:54.800><c> Okay.</c><00:37:55.680><c> That's</c><00:37:56.000><c> so</c><00:37:56.320><c> cool,</c>

00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
rotation. Yeah. Okay. That's so cool,
 

00:37:57.119 --> 00:37:58.230 align:start position:0%
rotation. Yeah. Okay. That's so cool,
man.<00:37:57.440><c> All</c><00:37:57.520><c> right.</c><00:37:57.680><c> Here</c><00:37:57.839><c> we</c><00:37:57.920><c> go.</c><00:37:58.079><c> All</c><00:37:58.079><c> right.</c>

00:37:58.230 --> 00:37:58.240 align:start position:0%

00:37:58.240 --> 00:37:59.510 align:start position:0%
man. All right. Here we go. All right.
Good.<00:37:58.480><c> I</c><00:37:58.640><c> think</c><00:37:58.720><c> we</c><00:37:58.880><c> have</c><00:37:58.960><c> time</c><00:37:59.119><c> for</c><00:37:59.200><c> one</c><00:37:59.359><c> more</c>

00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
Good. I think we have time for one more

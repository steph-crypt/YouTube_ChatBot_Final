over<00:17:14.880><c> to</c><00:17:15.160><c> and</c><00:17:15.360><c> and</c><00:17:15.520><c> made</c><00:17:15.760><c> to</c><00:17:15.959><c> look</c><00:17:16.199><c> like</c><00:17:16.400><c> Mars</c>

00:17:17.189 --> 00:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
over to and and made to look like Mars
 

00:17:17.199 --> 00:17:19.189 align:start position:0%
over to and and made to look like Mars
so<00:17:17.480><c> we</c><00:17:17.720><c> actually</c><00:17:18.039><c> exited</c><00:17:18.439><c> the</c><00:17:18.600><c> habitat</c><00:17:19.039><c> but</c>

00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
so we actually exited the habitat but
 

00:17:19.199 --> 00:17:21.230 align:start position:0%
so we actually exited the habitat but
stayed<00:17:19.520><c> within</c><00:17:19.760><c> a</c><00:17:19.880><c> defined</c><00:17:20.280><c> area</c><00:17:20.720><c> and</c><00:17:20.839><c> we</c><00:17:20.959><c> used</c>

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
stayed within a defined area and we used
 

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.069 align:start position:0%
stayed within a defined area and we used
two<00:17:21.400><c> different</c><00:17:21.679><c> mechanisms</c><00:17:22.240><c> we</c><00:17:22.360><c> used</c><00:17:22.600><c> virtual</c>

00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:23.079 align:start position:0%
two different mechanisms we used virtual
 

00:17:23.079 --> 00:17:25.949 align:start position:0%
two different mechanisms we used virtual
reality<00:17:23.839><c> so</c><00:17:24.079><c> we</c><00:17:24.240><c> actually</c><00:17:24.600><c> had</c><00:17:24.919><c> goggles</c><00:17:25.559><c> and</c><00:17:25.839><c> a</c>

00:17:25.949 --> 00:17:25.959 align:start position:0%

00:17:25.959 --> 00:17:27.870 align:start position:0%
reality so we actually had goggles and a

00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:27.880 align:start position:0%
treadmill that we got on and we were
 

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.510 align:start position:0%

actual Mars mission so you know we were
we<00:19:17.520><c> were</c><00:19:17.720><c> addressing</c><00:19:18.400><c> very</c><00:19:18.679><c> specific</c><00:19:19.080><c> things</c>

00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
we were addressing very specific things

we were addressing very specific things

00:19:21.549 --> 00:19:21.559 align:start position:0%
and that was not in the scope so but
 

00:19:21.559 --> 00:19:22.909 align:start position:0%
and that was not in the scope so but
that<00:19:21.679><c> would</c><00:19:21.799><c> be</c><00:19:21.960><c> really</c><00:19:22.200><c> really</c><00:19:22.400><c> cool</c><00:19:22.760><c> can</c>

00:19:22.909 --> 00:19:22.919 align:start position:0%
that would be really really cool can
 

00:19:22.919 --> 00:19:25.950 align:start position:0%
that would be really really cool can
imagine<00:19:23.280><c> another</c><00:19:24.039><c> such</c><00:19:24.480><c> Mission</c><00:19:25.480><c> analog</c>

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:25.960 align:start position:0%
imagine another such Mission analog
 

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.510 align:start position:0%
imagine another such Mission analog
mission<00:19:26.240><c> where</c><00:19:26.400><c> it's</c><00:19:26.640><c> it's</c><00:19:26.919><c> just</c><00:19:27.240><c> for</c><00:19:27.400><c> the</c>

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
mission where it's it's just for the
 

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.350 align:start position:0%
mission where it's it's just for the
gravity<00:19:27.960><c> part</c><00:19:28.559><c> yeah</c><00:19:28.840><c> and</c><00:19:28.960><c> that</c><00:19:29.039><c> would</c><00:19:29.200><c> be</c>

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
gravity part yeah and that would be
 

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:31.270 align:start position:0%
gravity part yeah and that would be
amazing<00:19:29.880><c> right</c><00:19:30.039><c> to</c><00:19:30.240><c> really</c><00:19:30.480><c> try</c><00:19:30.760><c> that</c><00:19:30.919><c> out</c><00:19:31.120><c> and</c>

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
amazing right to really try that out and
 

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:32.630 align:start position:0%
amazing right to really try that out and
see<00:19:31.559><c> how</c><00:19:31.760><c> that</c><00:19:31.840><c> would</c><00:19:32.000><c> feel</c><00:19:32.320><c> but</c><00:19:32.400><c> you</c><00:19:32.480><c> would</c>

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
see how that would feel but you would
 

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.549 align:start position:0%
see how that would feel but you would
have<00:19:32.760><c> to</c><00:19:32.880><c> rig</c><00:19:33.200><c> both</c><00:19:33.400><c> outside</c><00:19:33.840><c> and</c><00:19:34.080><c> inside</c><00:19:34.440><c> it</c>

00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
have to rig both outside and inside it
 

00:19:34.559 --> 00:19:36.190 align:start position:0%
have to rig both outside and inside it
would<00:19:34.720><c> be</c><00:19:35.039><c> you</c><00:19:35.120><c> know</c><00:19:35.280><c> resource</c><00:19:35.799><c> wise</c><00:19:36.000><c> it</c><00:19:36.080><c> would</c>

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:36.200 align:start position:0%
would be you know resource wise it would
 

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.390 align:start position:0%
would be you know resource wise it would
be<00:19:36.400><c> quite</c><00:19:36.679><c> a</c><00:19:36.799><c> heavy</c><00:19:37.080><c> lift</c><00:19:37.360><c> for</c><00:19:37.960><c> you'd</c><00:19:38.120><c> be</c><00:19:38.280><c> about</c>

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
be quite a heavy lift for you'd be about
 

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.350 align:start position:0%
be quite a heavy lift for you'd be about
on<00:19:38.520><c> Mars</c><00:19:38.760><c> you'd</c><00:19:38.919><c> be</c><00:19:39.039><c> about</c><00:19:39.240><c> 60</c><00:19:39.600><c> pounds</c><00:19:40.000><c> is</c><00:19:40.120><c> that</c>

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:40.360 align:start position:0%
on Mars you'd be about 60 pounds is that
 

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.909 align:start position:0%
on Mars you'd be about 60 pounds is that
right<00:19:41.280><c> yeah</c><00:19:41.880><c> that</c><00:19:42.000><c> sounds</c><00:19:42.240><c> about</c><00:19:42.480><c> right</c><00:19:42.679><c> yeah</c>

00:19:42.909 --> 00:19:42.919 align:start position:0%
right yeah that sounds about right yeah
 

00:19:42.919 --> 00:19:45.590 align:start position:0%
right yeah that sounds about right yeah
so<00:19:43.440><c> so</c><00:19:43.720><c> you</c><00:19:44.080><c> you'd</c><00:19:44.320><c> have</c><00:19:44.480><c> a</c><00:19:44.679><c> very</c><00:19:45.159><c> different</c>

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
so so you you'd have a very different
 

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.669 align:start position:0%
so so you you'd have a very different
different<00:19:45.960><c> experience</c><00:19:46.840><c> I</c><00:19:46.960><c> got</c><00:19:47.080><c> to</c><00:19:47.280><c> get</c><00:19:47.440><c> to</c>

00:19:47.669 --> 00:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
different experience I got to get to
 

00:19:47.679 --> 00:19:51.149 align:start position:0%

probably be the case um but for our

point<00:37:38.240><c> yeah</c><00:37:38.680><c> okay</c><00:37:39.160><c> why</c><00:37:39.240><c> do</c><00:37:39.359><c> we</c><00:37:39.480><c> build</c><00:37:39.720><c> James</c>

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:40.040 align:start position:0%
point yeah okay why do we build James
 

00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:43.150 align:start position:0%
point yeah okay why do we build James
web<00:37:40.720><c> to</c><00:37:41.000><c> go</c><00:37:41.240><c> where</c><00:37:41.520><c> we've</c><00:37:41.800><c> never</c><00:37:42.079><c> seen</c><00:37:42.520><c> before</c>

00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
definitely did have an aspect of that
 

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:11.990 align:start position:0%
definitely did have an aspect of that

00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
built into the activities we did just to
 

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.750 align:start position:0%
built into the activities we did just to

00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
be clear so on Mars with there's a lot
 

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:16.870 align:start position:0%
be clear so on Mars with there's a lot
of<00:42:13.880><c> dust</c><00:42:14.079><c> storms</c><00:42:14.960><c> so</c><00:42:15.680><c> dust</c><00:42:15.960><c> can</c><00:42:16.160><c> just</c><00:42:16.520><c> land</c><00:42:16.760><c> on</c>

00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
of dust storms so dust can just land on
 

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:19.510 align:start position:0%

your<00:42:17.040><c> solar</c><00:42:17.359><c> panels</c><00:42:18.280><c> and</c><00:42:18.400><c> so</c><00:42:18.680><c> you</c><00:42:18.920><c> dust</c><00:42:19.359><c> it's</c>

00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
your solar panels and so you dust it's
 

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:21.430 align:start position:0%
your solar panels and so you dust it's
like<00:42:19.839><c> like</c><00:42:19.920><c> the</c><00:42:20.079><c> UMP</c><00:42:20.480><c> at</c><00:42:20.640><c> the</c><00:42:20.720><c> home</c><00:42:20.920><c> plate</c>

00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:21.440 align:start position:0%

like like the UMP at the home plate
right<00:42:21.599><c> you</c><00:42:21.720><c> got</c><00:42:22.319><c> you</c><00:42:22.400><c> got</c><00:42:22.520><c> to</c><00:42:22.640><c> get</c><00:42:22.720><c> out</c><00:42:22.880><c> there</c>

00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:23.000 align:start position:0%
right you got you got to get out there
 

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.430 align:start position:0%
right you got you got to get out there
and<00:42:23.520><c> clean</c><00:42:23.800><c> those</c><00:42:24.400><c> panels</c><00:42:25.400><c> so</c><00:42:25.640><c> yeah</c><00:42:25.880><c> so</c><00:42:26.040><c> that</c>

00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:26.440 align:start position:0%
and clean those panels so yeah so that
 

00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:27.750 align:start position:0%
and clean those panels so yeah so that

00:42:30.190 --> 00:42:30.200 align:start position:0%
to do on Mars yeah okay go on yes and

00:44:52.109 --> 00:44:52.119 align:start position:0%
I think one of the reasons that NASA
 

00:44:52.119 --> 00:44:54.349 align:start position:0%
I think one of the reasons that NASA

00:44:54.349 --> 00:44:54.359 align:start position:0%
loves analoges is that you get ready for

circumference rational? Yeah. So, to be

clear, if you want the circum the
clear, if you want the circum the

circumference could be anything you
circumference could be anything you
circumference could be anything you

think what I think the intention of the
think what I think the intention of the
think what I think the intention of the
phrasing was that the ratio of the

circumference to the diameter could
circumference to the diameter could
never be or like if the diameter is a
never be or like if the diameter is a
never be or like if the diameter is a
whole number, the circumference will

never be rational. However you want to
never be rational. However you want to

phrase it, it's the relationship between

those two that's fundamentally

You make one of the other one nice, the

Um and so it's a very deep question to

let's assume that it's fully reduced. So

So there's no common factor you can

root of two. By definition, you're

saying that P ^2 / Q ^2 is equal to 2.
saying that P ^2 / Q ^2 is equal to 2.
saying that P ^2 / Q ^2 is equal to 2.
So that's what it would mean by

bottom that Q ^2 P ^2 is going to equal

up with some numbers where it was true,

up with some numbers where it was true,
you must admit that P ^2 is the same as

Um, yeah. And so you're like, okay, I

it's some even number. If you then write
it's some even number. If you then write
it's some even number. If you then write
this down algebraically and you replace

this down algebraically and you replace
it with 2 * K, you're going to conclude

that Q also has to be an even number.

Because when you take that key equation

P ^2= 2 * Q ^2 that ends up looking like
P ^2= 2 * Q ^2 that ends up looking like
P ^2= 2 * Q ^2 that ends up looking like
4 * K^2 = 2 * Q ^2. You divide some
4 * K^2 = 2 * Q ^2. You divide some
4 * K^2 = 2 * Q ^2. You divide some
stuff out and you say hey Q also has to

that P is even. You must conclude that Q
that P is even. You must conclude that Q
that P is even. You must conclude that Q

couple months back then. So what's the
couple months back then. So what's the
couple months back then. So what's the
difference between a periodic and a
difference between a periodic and a
difference between a periodic and a
non-periodic pattern? Great. So most of
non-periodic pattern? Great. So most of
non-periodic pattern? Great. So most of
the patterns you can think of are
the patterns you can think of are
the patterns you can think of are
periodic. Like it's kind of what we mean
periodic. Like it's kind of what we mean
periodic. Like it's kind of what we mean
by pattern almost. Yeah. Like if you
by pattern almost. Yeah. Like if you
by pattern almost. Yeah. Like if you
shift the whole picture and it looks
shift the whole picture and it looks
shift the whole picture and it looks
identical. So you take your hexagon
identical. So you take your hexagon
identical. So you take your hexagon
tiling and then you like shift your view
tiling and then you like shift your view
tiling and then you like shift your view
over by one hexagon, it looks identical.
over by one hexagon, it looks identical.
over by one hexagon, it looks identical.
So that's what we would mean by
So that's what we would mean by
So that's what we would mean by
periodic. Um it wasn't even known that
periodic. Um it wasn't even known that
periodic. Um it wasn't even known that
you could have a non-periodic tiling uh
you could have a non-periodic tiling uh
you could have a non-periodic tiling uh

a way to use these two tiles that each

that fills all of space, but it never
that fills all of space, but it never
that fills all of space, but it never
repeats. So it's a it's a it's a
repeats. So it's a it's a it's a

describable pattern. Um you can describe
describable pattern. Um you can describe

what it should be, but it never repeats.
what it should be, but it never repeats.
what it should be, but it never repeats.
So when you shift your viewing point, it
So when you shift your viewing point, it
So when you shift your viewing point, it
will never look identical. So there's no
will never look identical. So there's no
will never look identical. So there's no
way to shift it to be the same as what
way to shift it to be the same as what

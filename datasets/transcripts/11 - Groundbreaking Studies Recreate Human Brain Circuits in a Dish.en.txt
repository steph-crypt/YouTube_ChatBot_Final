when they are expressing their
prescribed function? Cuz a neuron has a
prescribed function? Cuz a neuron has a
prescribed function? Cuz a neuron has a
very specific function. Absolutely. How
very specific function. Absolutely. How
very specific function. Absolutely. How
do how do you know that they are
do how do you know that they are
do how do you know that they are
actually expressing that function? So we
actually expressing that function? So we
actually expressing that function? So we
do all kind of things like first of all
do all kind of things like first of all
do all kind of things like first of all
we just look to see very often you know
we just look to see very often you know
we just look to see very often you know
cells I mean not very often all the time
cells I mean not very often all the time
cells I mean not very often all the time
cells have a signature you know they
cells have a signature you know they
cells have a signature you know they
express a certain combination of genes
express a certain combination of genes
express a certain combination of genes
and so generally the first question is
and so generally the first question is
and so generally the first question is
if you think you've made a cortical
if you think you've made a cortical
if you think you've made a cortical
neuron let's say a neuron from the outer
neuron let's say a neuron from the outer
neuron let's say a neuron from the outer
layer of the brain how do you know that
layer of the brain how do you know that
layer of the brain how do you know that
it's a cortical neuron well first of all
it's a cortical neuron well first of all
it's a cortical neuron well first of all
you kind of like look at what genes it
you kind of like look at what genes it
you kind of like look at what genes it
expresses and you compare it with what
expresses and you compare it with what
expresses and you compare it with what
we know from a neuron in the actual
we know from a neuron in the actual
we know from a neuron in the actual
brain then you can look at how it looks
brain then you can look at how it looks
brain then you can look at how it looks
They're often neurons in the cortex have
They're often neurons in the cortex have
They're often neurons in the cortex have
sort of like a pyramidal shape. We call
sort of like a pyramidal shape. We call
sort of like a pyramidal shape. We call
them parameal neurons. So you look Do
them parameal neurons. So you look Do
them parameal neurons. So you look Do
they look pyramidal? Pyramal. That means
they look pyramidal? Pyramal. That means
they look pyramidal? Pyramal. That means
like a pyramid. Yeah, exactly.
like a pyramid. Yeah, exactly.
like a pyramid. Yeah, exactly.
Pyramidal. Okay. For me, parameal. Yeah.
Pyramidal. Okay. For me, parameal. Yeah.
Pyramidal. Okay. For me, parameal. Yeah.
I guess they really look like a a tiny
I guess they really look like a a tiny
I guess they really look like a a tiny
pyramid. Yeah. An inverted pyramid. Like
pyramid. Yeah. An inverted pyramid. Like
pyramid. Yeah. An inverted pyramid. Like
that's how they sit in the cortex. So
that's how they sit in the cortex. So
that's how they sit in the cortex. So
you look at this like the shape of the
you look at this like the shape of the
you look at this like the shape of the
of the cell body. Or the other thing is
of the cell body. Or the other thing is
of the cell body. Or the other thing is
sometimes they move in very specific
sometimes they move in very specific
sometimes they move in very specific
ways. And that's actually how the first
ways. And that's actually how the first
ways. And that's actually how the first
assemblids were actually looking at how
assemblids were actually looking at how
assemblids were actually looking at how
cells are moving. So here here's an
cells are moving. So here here's an
cells are moving. So here here's an
interesting fact. You know, you may
interesting fact. You know, you may
interesting fact. You know, you may
think that, you know, you have all the
think that, you know, you have all the
think that, you know, you have all the
cell types in the brain, right? But
cell types in the brain, right? But
cell types in the brain, right? But
they're all made, you know, when you
they're all made, you know, when you
they're all made, you know, when you
build a brain, they're all made sort of
build a brain, they're all made sort of
build a brain, they're all made sort of
like in their place and then they sit
like in their place and then they sit
like in their place and then they sit
there. Actually, it's more an, you know,
there. Actually, it's more an, you know,
there. Actually, it's more an, you know,
a rule rather than an exception that
a rule rather than an exception that
a rule rather than an exception that
cells do not reside in the place in
cells do not reside in the place in
cells do not reside in the place in
which they're born in the brain. So
which they're born in the brain. So
which they're born in the brain. So
there is a lot of movement. So think
there is a lot of movement. So think
there is a lot of movement. So think
about the cortex, okay? like the outer
about the cortex, okay? like the outer
about the cortex, okay? like the outer
layer of the brain. It has neurons that
layer of the brain. It has neurons that
layer of the brain. It has neurons that
are exciting other neurons and it has
are exciting other neurons and it has
are exciting other neurons and it has
neurons that are inhibiting other
neurons that are inhibiting other
neurons that are inhibiting other
neurons. And there is a very good
neurons. And there is a very good
neurons. And there is a very good
balance between the two of them. Too
balance between the two of them. Too
balance between the two of them. Too
much excitation, you get epilepsy,
much excitation, you get epilepsy,
much excitation, you get epilepsy,
right? So, you know, think about that.
right? So, you know, think about that.
right? So, you know, think about that.
Now, here's the interesting thing. All
Now, here's the interesting thing. All
Now, here's the interesting thing. All
the excitatory neurons are born there in
the excitatory neurons are born there in
the excitatory neurons are born there in
the cortex. But all the neurons that are
the cortex. But all the neurons that are
the cortex. But all the neurons that are
inhibitory are built in a deep part of
inhibitory are built in a deep part of
inhibitory are built in a deep part of
the brain. And literally during brain
the brain. And literally during brain
the brain. And literally during brain
development they start moving crawling
development they start moving crawling
development they start moving crawling
for inches and for many many months
for inches and for many many months
for inches and for many many months
until they arrive into the cortex and
until they arrive into the cortex and
until they arrive into the cortex and
then they kind like establish that
then they kind like establish that
then they kind like establish that
balance. So in order for you to build
balance. So in order for you to build
balance. So in order for you to build
that cortex it's not enough just to make
that cortex it's not enough just to make
that cortex it's not enough just to make
the excitatory cells you have to make
the excitatory cells you have to make
the excitatory cells you have to make
the inhibitory cells. But then the
the inhibitory cells. But then the
the inhibitory cells. But then the
question is how do they come together?
question is how do they come together?
question is how do they come together?
How do they assemble? because that's
How do they assemble? because that's
How do they assemble? because that's
where the name assemblid came and
where the name assemblid came and
where the name assemblid came and
essentially the vision was like almost
essentially the vision was like almost
essentially the vision was like almost
you know 12 years ago was let's make
you know 12 years ago was let's make
you know 12 years ago was let's make
these two parts of the brain the one
these two parts of the brain the one
these two parts of the brain the one
that makes the excitatory neurons and
that makes the excitatory neurons and
that makes the excitatory neurons and
the one that makes the inhibitor neurons
the one that makes the inhibitor neurons
the one that makes the inhibitor neurons
and then just put them close to each
and then just put them close to each
and then just put them close to each
other and hopefully the cells will know
other and hopefully the cells will know
other and hopefully the cells will know
what to do because we certainly don't
what to do because we certainly don't
what to do because we certainly don't
know how to guide them to um to to move

for another 3 hours kind like smell
for another 3 hours kind like smell
for another 3 hours kind like smell
where the cortex is make another jump

with instructions of how to do this and

I think that's what happens in
I think that's what happens in
I think that's what happens in
development and that's why you build a

Well, this sort of like a self assembly
Well, this sort of like a self assembly
actually works really well early in

development in the sense that all the
development in the sense that all the

the as you progress in development, the
the as you progress in development, the
the as you progress in development, the
cells become less and less permissive.

We don't have cells moving in our brain

there's this rare rare syndrome I mean
there's this rare rare syndrome I mean
there's this rare rare syndrome I mean
literally there about we found about 30
literally there about we found about 30
literally there about we found about 30
40 patients in the English speaking
40 patients in the English speaking
40 patients in the English speaking
world today very few but they have a

cells every time a neuron communicates
with another neuron it opens up these
with another neuron it opens up these
with another neuron it opens up these
channels lets calcium in and it
channels lets calcium in and it
channels lets calcium in and it
essentially translates electrical
essentially translates electrical
essentially translates electrical
information into chemical information
information into chemical information
information into chemical information
inside the cell. So it turns out that
inside the cell. So it turns out that
inside the cell. So it turns out that
these patients have one single letter
these patients have one single letter
these patients have one single letter
mutation in their entire genome. one
mutation in their entire genome. one

single letter that makes this channel
single letter that makes this channel
single letter that makes this channel
open for a little bit longer. That's it.
open for a little bit longer. That's it.
open for a little bit longer. That's it.
It's not all the time open. It's not,
It's not all the time open. It's not,
It's not all the time open. It's not,
you know, just slightly longer. So, the
you know, just slightly longer. So, the
you know, just slightly longer. So, the
idea was that if you were to model this
idea was that if you were to model this
idea was that if you were to model this
disease, you could make neurons from
disease, you could make neurons from
disease, you could make neurons from
these patients, then look at them and
these patients, then look at them and
these patients, then look at them and
actually monitor calcium inside the
actually monitor calcium inside the
actually monitor calcium inside the
cells. And if we were to see more
cells. And if we were to see more
cells. And if we were to see more
calcium, it means that we started
calcium, it means that we started
calcium, it means that we started
modeling the disease. And that's exactly
modeling the disease. And that's exactly
modeling the disease. And that's exactly
what we did because we wanted to really
what we did because we wanted to really
what we did because we wanted to really
ascertain that we were really studying a
ascertain that we were really studying a
ascertain that we were really studying a
disease process that is relevant. So if
disease process that is relevant. So if
disease process that is relevant. So if
if you know the actual letter and when
if you know the actual letter and when
if you know the actual letter and when
you you're talking about that you're
you you're talking about that you're
you you're talking about that you're
talking about the DNA sequencing. So if
talking about the DNA sequencing. So if
talking about the DNA sequencing. So if
you know the actual letter, why not do
you know the actual letter, why not do
you know the actual letter, why not do
something like crisper where you just go
something like crisper where you just go
something like crisper where you just go
in and snip out the letter? Well, sadly
in and snip out the letter? Well, sadly
in and snip out the letter? Well, sadly
you would have to change it everywhere
you would have to change it everywhere
you would have to change it everywhere
in the brain probably. There you go. And

in the brain probably. There you go. And
that and that is not you know doable
that and that is not you know doable
that and that is not you know doable
today. Okay. And these patients are very
today. Okay. And these patients are very

severely affected. I mean they'll have
severely affected. I mean they'll have
severely affected. I mean they'll have
epilepsy. They'll have autism spectrum
epilepsy. They'll have autism spectrum
epilepsy. They'll have autism spectrum
disorder. They have a heart problem. So
disorder. They have a heart problem. So
disorder. They have a heart problem. So
many of them would die because of a
many of them would die because of a
many of them would die because of a

heart problem. And so that's that's
heart problem. And so that's that's
where we sort of like started with with
where we sort of like started with with
where we sort of like started with with
cells from these patients. And then with

cells from these patients. And then with
this models that I've told you now over
this models that I've told you now over
this models that I've told you now over
the past 15 years, we kept building the
the past 15 years, we kept building the
the past 15 years, we kept building the
models to be more complex and try to
models to be more complex and try to
models to be more complex and try to
understand this disease. And first we
understand this disease. And first we
understand this disease. And first we
understood how calcium gets into the
understood how calcium gets into the
understood how calcium gets into the
cells. Then we saw that the cells are

the body of those patients right and so
the body of those patients right and so
the body of those patients right and so
of course the question is like how do
of course the question is like how do
of course the question is like how do
you actually you know know that it would
you actually you know know that it would

work you know generally what we do is we

use an animal model for the disease
use an animal model for the disease
use an animal model for the disease
right? um you have an animal model, you
right? um you have an animal model, you
right? um you have an animal model, you
have a mouse that has the same mutation.
have a mouse that has the same mutation.
have a mouse that has the same mutation.
Well, it turns out that if you do this
Well, it turns out that if you do this
Well, it turns out that if you do this
mutation in a mouse, it doesn't really

recapitulate aspects of disease. It
recapitulate aspects of disease. It
recapitulate aspects of disease. It
doesn't work that well. So now what do
doesn't work that well. So now what do
doesn't work that well. So now what do
you do? You can also just go straight
you do? You can also just go straight
you do? You can also just go straight
into a patient. You want to make sure
into a patient. You want to make sure
into a patient. You want to make sure
that sort of like it it works sort of
that sort of like it it works sort of
that sort of like it it works sort of
like in an invivo setting. And so that's
like in an invivo setting. And so that's
like in an invivo setting. And so that's
why one of the things that we've done
why one of the things that we've done
why one of the things that we've done
over the past years is actually also
over the past years is actually also
over the past years is actually also
develop transplantation methods. Meaning
develop transplantation methods. Meaning
develop transplantation methods. Meaning
that while the organ and the assemblies
that while the organ and the assemblies
that while the organ and the assemblies
that we've been building are rather
that we've been building are rather
that we've been building are rather
complex, they still don't receive
complex, they still don't receive
complex, they still don't receive
sensory input. They don't mature to the
sensory input. They don't mature to the
sensory input. They don't mature to the
same level. So what we started doing is
same level. So what we started doing is
same level. So what we started doing is
actually transplanting them. Meaning we
actually transplanting them. Meaning we
actually transplanting them. Meaning we
essentially take the organoid that we've
essentially take the organoid that we've
essentially take the organoid that we've
made in a dish, but now we put it into
made in a dish, but now we put it into
made in a dish, but now we put it into
the brain of a rat. And then if you do
the brain of a rat. And then if you do
the brain of a rat. And then if you do
it early in development, then the rat
it early in development, then the rat
it early in development, then the rat
can actually grow to have about a third
can actually grow to have about a third
can actually grow to have about a third
of a hemisphere to be made out of human
of a hemisphere to be made out of human
of a hemisphere to be made out of human

know why would you even do that
know why would you even do that
know why would you even do that
experiment? Well the reason is because
experiment? Well the reason is because
experiment? Well the reason is because
now we actually have human tissue from
now we actually have human tissue from
now we actually have human tissue from
patients in a living organism and you
patients in a living organism and you
patients in a living organism and you
can test a drug. So what we did is we
can test a drug. So what we did is we
can test a drug. So what we did is we
took the drug that we tested in vitro in
took the drug that we tested in vitro in
took the drug that we tested in vitro in
a dish but then injected it into the rat
a dish but then injected it into the rat
a dish but then injected it into the rat
the way you would do into a patient but
the way you would do into a patient but
the way you would do into a patient but
then we looked at the effect on human
then we looked at the effect on human
then we looked at the effect on human
cells making sure that it doesn't kill
cells making sure that it doesn't kill
cells making sure that it doesn't kill
human cells right or it doesn't do
human cells right or it doesn't do
human cells right or it doesn't do
something else. So that is like one way
something else. So that is like one way
something else. So that is like one way
that allows us actually to test
that allows us actually to test
that allows us actually to test
therapeutics in a way that is like safe
therapeutics in a way that is like safe
therapeutics in a way that is like safe
essentially. So the thing is if you want
essentially. So the thing is if you want
essentially. So the thing is if you want
to solve the issues of complex brain
to solve the issues of complex brain
to solve the issues of complex brain
disorders, you're going to need more
disorders, you're going to need more

complex assemblids. Mhm. Now you've
complex assemblids. Mhm. Now you've

taken this assemblid up a notch, have
taken this assemblid up a notch, have
taken this assemblid up a notch, have
you not? um daisy chained four organoids

And so this started like you know maybe
And so this started like you know maybe
And so this started like you know maybe
five six years ago when we thought could
five six years ago when we thought could

we actually build a circuit that is

reconstruct the cortical spinal pathway.
reconstruct the cortical spinal pathway.
reconstruct the cortical spinal pathway.
So that means and you you you know this
So that means and you you you know this
So that means and you you you know this
really well everybody knows this this is

could we actually reconstruct this? You

could we actually reconstruct this? You
may think that it's easy, but here is we

don't know how the cells find each other

in development. By the way, we have no

is we made an organoid that resembles

is we made an organoid that resembles
the cortex, one that resembles the

human muscle from a biopsy. You can get
human muscle from a biopsy. You can get

and then we put them all three together.
and then we put them all three together.
and then we put them all three together.

out that we have at least two pathways
out that we have at least two pathways
out that we have at least two pathways

just want to put it on the table. Okay.
just want to put it on the table. Okay.

across your field of view. So if you

clock you can set a clock by it. Okay.
If a gravitational wave passes by it,
If a gravitational wave passes by it,
If a gravitational wave passes by it,
right, there's a change in the rate,
right, there's a change in the rate,
right, there's a change in the rate,
right? You'll see the the rhythm change.

then you look to see if it is there if

      "AI: Albert Einstein was a renowned physicist who is best known for his theory of relativity, which revolutionized the field of theoretical physics. He was born in Germany in 1879 and showed an early aptitude for mathematics and physics. His work on the photoelectric effect won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. Einstein's most famous equation, E=mc^2, demonstrates the equivalence of energy (E) and mass (m), with \"c\" being the speed of light in a vacuum. This equation has been foundational to the development of nuclear energy. Einstein emigrated to the United States in the 1930s due to the rise of the Nazi regime in Germany. He accepted a position at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where he remained until his retirement. He passed away in 1955.\u001b[0m\n",
